Preface 
The recent pandemic has brought about significant change resulting in the 
utilization of scientific knowledge for the benefit of mankind. The analysis 
of data obtained from various reliable sources has played an important role 
in this conclusion. Moreover, industry 4.0 needs optimization of human 
resources and infrastructure to enhance productivity, and in this context, 
the Internet of Things (IoT) opens the gateway for qualitative outcomes 
in different arenas like healthcare, environment, automation, security, 
integrated service, cloud computing, etc. 
The field of IoT becomes more promising when data analytics is 
mixed with it, and therefore, a complete automated manufacturing/service 
sector can be implemented with a broader area of coverage. The present 
generation of academicians, therefore, need to collaborate with industrial 
representatives who are working in this area. This will not only prove 
beneficial for the industrial revolution, but academics will also find more 
food for thought. This type of collaborative approach will help reduce the 
gap between industry and academia, and therefore, augment the progress 
of society. 
Nowadays AI/ML/IoT has become a boon to society. World leaders are 
funding huge amounts of money to these research fields. Even the Indian 
Government is encouraging and trying to fund these areas. Currently, 
in India, many startups are coming up with unique ideas of using AI in 
agriculture. As we know, agriculture is the second-most booming market 
worldwide. However, India is suffering from a lack of AI experts currently 
and many AI training initiatives by various institutions are ongoing. Most 
of these though are very theoretical and provide only textbook knowledge 
rather than a practical approach. 
Practical approaches help learners understand the gaps and limitations 
in the current AI frameworks as it is still only a research field. Even though 
many initiatives are being taken to utilize AI in daily activities, they are 
mostly formulated through pattern search/match problems. The goal of 
AI goes beyond this. Hence, practitioners need to understand these gaps 
and limitations and focus on these areas rather than on how to write codes 
using available programming tools. 

 
xvi 
Preface 
Knowledge in these areas should be focussed on understanding open 
areas and challenges in the current available frameworks and architecture, 
and exploration of alternative possibilities instead of training on a coding 
platform, solving linear equations on predefined datasets that have been 
solved 50 years ago. 
The present edited book is an honest step towards the creation of a 
collaboration where both academicians and industrial workers make novel 
initiatives for solving the present-day problems in various industries and 
enhancing people’s comfort in their homes. Several key and emerging areas 
like automobile, hydraulics, manufacturing, hospitality, home automation, 
industrial optimization, and most importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic 
situation is covered within these two volumes. 
The results of the book are novel, and can safely be applied in their 
respective domains. Researchers have shown the simulative findings of 
their proposals, and comparative study reveals the supremacy of their 
findings compared to the existing technologies. In this context, the editors 
expect that the solutions presented herewith can meet the ever-increasing 
demand of industries, at least in a few sectors. More optimized solutions 
can be generated by another group of researchers/workers in this field, 
perhaps, in the near future. The editors thus hope that the present work is 
a valuable step towards the betterment of civilization. 

 
Introduction 
The Internet of Things (IoT) was created to meet the ever-increasing 
demand for connectivity and easy integration with other devices as well 
as virtual association with big data analytic (BDA) platforms. However, 
many hurdles exist in reaching this goal, including the ever-growing need 
for customer satisfaction. This involves data collection, design issues, 
application connectivity, implementation hurdles, storage, and analysis in 
a cloud-based environment. These associated features along with the IoT 
security and privacy problems require researchers to investigate optimized 
solutions while keeping track of the financial requirements. 
It is already clear that the evolution in the domain of AI can neither be 
achieved by only computer engineers or neuroscientists. Many collabora­
tive initiatives between engineers and neuro-scientists by world-renowned 
institutions have taken place to achieve this, and these initiatives are 
driving success in the use of AI towards society’s use of IoT devices, engi­
neering, etc. As a result, the editors believe that this book will be useful 
to academics as well as developers who are seeking AI-based solutions 
associated with a novel embedded system. 
Healthcare applications that use IoT are used by both individuals and 
healthcare businesses in this era of pandemic, with a rise in the number of 
diseases worldwide. This necessitates the creation of analytical reports – a 
necessary component for the success of such healthcare applications. In 
particular, a large amount of data is generated that must be evaluated in 
order to produce the desired results. To do this, a cloud-based analytical 
solution will be the best option, as it will allow for speedier report genera­
tion than traditional methods. 
Today, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two primary 
controlling realms. Every day, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created, 
according to estimates. Big data is a word that refers to a large volume of 
data in both structured and unstructured formats. Big data analytics is used 
in businesses and other application fields with high information density 
to produce predictions and forecasts. This helps businesses make better 
decisions in order to strengthen their operations.

Introduction 
Big data analytics is a technique for analyzing a large amount of data at 
once. Big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) were created on indepen­
dent technologies; nevertheless, with time, they have been intertwined to 
improve their functionality. Since there is a scarcity of big data analysts, 
the data generated by the apps is not efficiently exploited and examined. 
For real-time IoT applications, higher synchronization between hardware, 
code, and interfacing is required. 
The objective of this book is to produce comprehensive cutting-edge 
findings (either in prototype or model format) based on Internet-of-Things 
embedded with Deep Learning technology, which will be beneficial for 
people from all walks of life. The major focus is to create a space for an 
open AI/ML and IoT community across India and worldwide of doctors, 
engineers, researchers, and industry practitioners to develop products and 
create frameworks for addressing open challenges and gaps towards AGI 
for mankind. With this, we hope that this earnest endeavour will become a 
success and prove useful to readers.

ABSTRACT 
A connected automatic healthcare system can play a major role in 
enabling patients to access and track their health data and permit for flaw­
less communication with the providers of healthcare. The applications 
of IoT devices in the healthcare business facilitate doctors in observing 
patient activities and advanced treatment and give suggestions regarding 
patient’s health with the decision tools and automation technologies. With 
the employment of this automatic technology, there are incomparable 
benefits that may improve the standard and potency of treatments and 
consequently improve the health of the patients with reduced cost. As the 
range of patients is increasing day by day, the healthcare business plays 
a crucial part in the generation of massive amounts of data. The amount 
of data is continually growing, and that comes from numerous sources; 
managing this information is extremely critical. Moreover, it is very chal­
lenging to retrieve this information and for further investigation. Big data 
analytics (BDA) is an alternative approach to healthcare systems that must 
estimate the affordable time for making sensible discretions organizing

future views, and maximizing value. The analyzed information helps 
physicians to create choices for patients. In fact, healthcare BDA has the 
ability to lower treatment costs, predict epidemic outbreaks, avert prevent­
able diseases, and improve people’s overall quality of life. This chapter 
examines the need for IoT in the healthcare business, data analysis, and 
BDA. Investigations into various sorts of existing big IoT data analytics, 
as well as the relationship between IoT and data analytics in the healthcare 
industry, are also explained. The chapter also focuses on open challenges 
faced in the real-time implementation of connected healthcare and BDA. 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
Mechanization has a major impact on the economy in the general global 
financial system, and in our everyday lives. Engineers are attempting 
to construct complex systems by combining automated devices with 
mathematical and organizational tools for a large number of applications. 
The use of digital control systems and their application in information 
technology minimizes the need for human labor in the production of 
goods and services, known as automation. The employment of computers 
in healthcare is referred to as automation, where various technologies 
increase productivity in the delivery of medical services. The use of 
automation in the form of control systems and advanced technology to 
eliminate or reduce the need for manual tasks is referred to as automated 
healthcare solutions. For the sake of performance, this technology makes 
use of modern techniques and equipment. The automated healthcare 
management system [1] (AHMS) is a computerized system that assists 
in the management and administration of patient data. They allow you to 
keep an eye on your loved one’s safety, protection, and health as you can 
do it from the convenience of your own home. Many routine activities, 
such as data entry, record maintenance, and patient health monitoring, are 
part of the healthcare industry. 
With the introduction of computers in recent years, clinical tests and 
medical records in healthcare systems have become more standardized 
[2]. Electronic medical records (EMR) are kept up to date in order to offer 
better care to patients and physicians. As a result, medical care providers 
would have even more accessibility to a patient’s complete medical 
history and all of the patient’s medical information. This involves medical

detections, medications, and data related to them, such as aversions, 
enumeration, and diagnostic sample-test outputs. The component of the 
automated healthcare system is depicted in Figure 1.1. 
FIGURE 1.1 Automated healthcare. 
There was a significant reduction in unnecessary and additional inspec­
tions as a result of this, and there is greater collaboration among various 
healthcare providers. Professionals in healthcare reported that they use 
internet-based and automated platforms to advance in their medical prac­
tice by using auto prompts for immunizations, cancer detection, and other 
periodic inspections. 
Data is vital for any organization because it is often used to predict 
future behavior based on available data and current situations with certain 
parameters. In healthcare, administrative, and demographic data, diagnosis, 
care, prescription medications, laboratory testing, physiologic tracking 
data, hospitalization, patient insurance, and other data are all collected 
[3]. The most popular sources of health statistics are assessments, clinical 
and administrative reports, billing information, health statistics, inspec­
tions, diagnosis codes, and peer-reviewed literature. Automated healthcare 
includes patients in healthcare facilities, the number of physicians, nurses, 
and other medical professionals. These experts all keep track of patient

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
care data and ensure that patients receive quality care and the best possible 
results. In today’s dynamic environment, healthcare organizations manu­
facture immense knowledge that has several advantages and challenges 
and needs advanced technologies. Managing this immense knowledge 
could be a major task for organizations. 
The study of current and past data related to the market in order to 
forecast tendencies can enhance services and even handle healthcare 
analytics which is the study of disease transmission. The industry 
sector covers a wide range of sectors and offers both macro and micro 
viewpoints. It has the potential to lead to improved patient care, clinical 
records, diagnostics, and business management. Another area where 
healthcare data analytics shines is in providing information to hospital 
administration that allows for the most efficient scheduling of physicians. 
In this situation, healthcare analytics provides a birds-eye perspective 
of physician reports and patient history, as well as the requirement to 
ensure that the most vulnerable patients are referred to the appropriate 
doctor or specialist. There are advances within the technology that helps 
in generating additional knowledge, which becomes unmanageable with 
the current potential. This creates a state of concern to develop new 
approaches so as to rearrange the information and extract useful patterns 
and apply this for future analysis. 
1.2 TECHNOLOGIES USED IN AUTOMATED HEALTHCARE 
Communication device computation, i.e., IoT, internet mobile Technology, 
cloud services, data analytics, 5G, nanoelectronics, and machine intelli­
gence, as well as current biotechnology, are at the heart of smart healthcare 
[4]. In all facets of smart healthcare, these innovations are commonly 
used. The commonly used technologies in healthcare automation are 
shown in Figure 1.2. In Medical health-related issues, IIoT (internet IoT) 
plays a major significant role that benefits patients, caretakers, healthcare 
professionals, hospitals, and other connected organizations. In the case 
of patients, IoT has improved people’s survival, especially for the elderly 
or those who live alone, by allowing for continuous tracing of routine 
activities or illnesses. In the healthcare sector, cloud computing improves 
productivity while lowering costs.

Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
FIGURE 1.2 Automated healthcare with major technologies. 
The exchange of medical records is made easier and more protected with 
cloud smart technology, which also mechanizes the methodologies with 
backend processes, and also allows the development and maintenance of 
telehealth apps simpler. It has given people the ability to collect, process, 
evaluate, and assimilate vast amounts of disparate, organized, and unstruc­
tured data generated by today’s healthcare systems. Big data analytics 
(BDA) has increasingly been used to help in the delivery of treatment and 
disease research. 
1.2.1 THE IOT AND ISSUES OF HEALTHCARE 
The smart device-based IoT is a tool of interconnected, smart devices that 
can collect and transmit data across a wireless network without requiring 
human engagement. The opportunities for personal or professional devel­
opment are limitless. Because of internet of things (IoT)-enabled equip­
ment, remote access in the medical industry is now possible. The IoT has 
the ability to keep patients safe and secure while also helping doctors to 
provide exceptional care [5]. Interactions with doctors have also become 
simpler and more effective, which has improved patient involvement and 
satisfaction. 
In IoT, medical devices can collect vital data and transmit it to doctors 
in real-time. Regardless of place or time, the reports offer an accurate

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
assessment of the patient’s condition. Patients would be able to commu­
nicate with experts with big thanks to technology, where doctors can now 
practice medicine from the solace of their own space-connected devices 
and wearables. IoT provides benefits to patients, doctors, and hospitals in 
automated healthcare systems. 
1. For Patients: The IoT has improved people’s survival, especially 
the survival of the elderly or those who live alone, by allowing for 
continuous tracing of everyday routines or illnesses. An individual 
or a concerned family member will receive warning signals if 
these activities change. Calorie counters, blood pressure, and heart 
rate can all be checked using exercise bands and other wireless 
devices. 
2. For Doctors and Healthcare Professionals: Using IoT-enabled 
medical devices, doctors can keep better track of their patient’s 
health. They will also see if any immediate medical attention is 
needed. Data obtained from IoT-enabled medical devices will 
assist doctors in determining the most effective treatment strategy 
for their patients and achieving the desired results. 
3. For Hospitals: Hospitals can use IoT-enabled medical devices 
with sensors to check fridge and freezer temperatures, regulate 
drug inventory, and track the real-time location of ventilation 
tubes, mobility aids, nebulizers, and other hospital instruments. 
1.2.1.1 THE BENEFITS OF IOT IN AUTOMATED HEALTHCARE 
1. Remote Monitoring: Real-time remote monitoring via IoT Based 
devices and smart notifications can accurately identify illnesses, 
cure diseases, and save lives in the case of a medical emergency. 
2. Prevention of Diseases: Intelligent sensors monitor health 
status, lifestyle factors, and the ecosystem in order to recommend 
precautionary measures that will lower the incidence of infectious 
diseases and traumatic situations.

Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
3. Reduction in Healthcare Cost: The IoT eliminates the need for 
expensive doctor visits and hospital admissions, as well as making 
research more accessible. 
4. Medical Data Accessibility: It allows patients to receive high-
quality treatment while also assisting healthcare providers in 
making the best medical choices and avoiding complications. 
5. Better Treatment Governance: IoT devices aid in the tracking of 
medication administration and treatment response, as well as the 
reduction of medical errors. 
6. Quality Health Management: Healthcare organizations can 
acquire vital information on equipment and workforce produc-
tivity by utilizing IoT devices, which they can then utilize to make 
recommendations for improvements. 
1.2.2 OVERVIEW OF BIG DATA 
Big data is a word that refers to large volumes of data that can solve many 
real-life problems. It has piqued people’s interest in recent decades due 
to the enormous potential it possesses. Various government and corpo-
rate industries collect, store, and evaluate data in order to improve their 
services. People working for different organizations all over the world 
generate vast amounts of data every day. The term “Big Data” [6–9] 
refers to the enormous quantities of data that are produced, replicated, 
and consumed. The International Data Corporation (IDC) predicted the 
digital data size to be at 130 exabytes (EB) in 2005. The digital universe 
reached around 16,000 EB in 2017. By 2020, according to IDC, the digital 
universe will have grown to 40,000 EB [3]. 
1.2.2.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF BIG DATA 
The following characteristics can be used to characterize big data: 
1. Volume: A significant amount of data is referred to as “volume.” 
The amount of data plays a critical role in determining its worth. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
When the amount of data is extremely high, it is referred to as “Big 
Data.” This shows that the quantity of data in a collection decides 
whether or not it can be categorized as big data. 
2. Variety: Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data types 
are all content in that section by default. It may also apply to a 
variety of sources. The variety of data comes from sources both 
within and outside the company. 
Structured data is simply data that has been structured. It usually 
refers to data that has been specified in terms of size and format. 
Semi-structured data is data that is organized in a semi-structured 
manner. It’s a kind of data that doesn’t follow the traditional data 
structure. This form of data is represented by log files. 
Data that has not been organized is referred to as unstructured data. 
It usually refers to data that doesn’t exactly fit into the traditional 
row and column structure of a relational database. Unstructured 
data includes things like text, images, and videos that can’t be 
restored in the forms of tables or rows and columns. 
3. Velocity: The term velocity refers to the rapid accumulation of 
data. Data comes in at a high rate from computers, networks, social 
networking sites, cell phones, and other outlets in high velocity. 
This determines how quickly data is produced and processed in 
order to meet demands. 
4. Variability: It alludes to data inconsistencies and uncertainty, i.e., 
available data can become chaotic at times, and reliability and 
efficiency are difficult to monitor. Because of the numerous data 
dimensions arising from big Data can take many different shapes 
and come from a variety of different sources. 
5. Value: Data is of little value or significance in and of itself; it must 
be turned into something useful in order to obtain information. As 
a result, one can claim the value and it is the most powerful of the 
five Vs.

1.2.2.2 REQUIREMENTS OF BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE 
In the healthcare system, big data is the data generated by the advent of 
digital technology that capture patient records and aid in the management 
of hospital outcomes, which would otherwise be too broad and complex 
for conventional technologies. Big data in healthcare refers to the gath­
ering, analysis, and application of data that is too large or complex to be 
understood using conventional data processing methods. Machine learning 
algorithms and data scientists are often used to process big data. 
1.2.2.3 HEALTHCARE BIG DATA AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS 
FEATURES 
Automated healthcare is an interdisciplinary framework designed to 
prevent, diagnose, and treat human health issues or impairments. Medical 
professionals, healthcare facilities for supplying pharmaceuticals and 
other diagnostic or therapeutic technology, and a finance institution are all 
essential components of a healthcare system. Examples include hospital 
reports, patient medical records, medical test results, and IoT applica­
tions in healthcare big data outlets. Biomedical science generates a major 
amount of big data that is applicable to public health. Depending on the 
severity of the situation, different levels of treatment are required of the 
case. Professionals use it for primary care, as well as for acute care that 
necessitates the use of qualified professionals termed as secondary care, 
tertiary care such as advanced medical inquiry and treatment, diagnostic or 
therapeutic techniques. This data must be properly handled and processed 
in order to obtain meaningful information. 
1.2.2.4 BIG DATA SOURCES FOR HEALTHCARE 
Individuals are the source of all health data; however, the most direct 
source is informal personal data collection from a variety of sources. The 
sources of medical big data are given in Figure 1.3.

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
FIGURE 1.3 Big data in healthcare. 
1. Wearable Devices: People can now monitor their heartbeat, 
cholesterol levels, weight, degree of activity, and amount of stress 
by using wearable devices. 
2. Apps on Smart Phones: On smartphones, there are apps that 
monitor a user’s workout routine and intensity, as well as the 
amount and quality of sleep they get. 
3. Sensors and Medical Devices: Medical devices and sensors that 
can transfer data to the cloud include pulse dosimeters, insulin 
monitors, digital scales, heart rate monitors, Oximetry sensors, 
motion detectors, and future sensors that will deliver data from 
thousands of patients on a continuous basis. 
4. Electronic Medical Records (EMR): EHRs are intended to give 
a more comprehensive view of a patient’s medical information 
throughout lifetime. 

 
11 
Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
5. Electronic Health Records (EHR): A patient’s electronic health 
record (EHR) is a digitized representation of his or her medical 
records for paper document. EHRs are patient-centered, real-time 
databases that make information available to the public to autho-
rized users promptly and securely. 
6. Insurance Companies: Claims from private insurance companies 
and plans, claims from government health plans, and claims from 
pharmaceutical companies are all covered by insurance providers. 
7. Other Clinical Data: Data received from medical imaging, 
research lab, pharmaceutics, health coverage, and other admin-
istrative data, as well as physician’s written notes and prescrip-
tions from computerized physician and clinical decision support 
systems. 
8. Search Engine Data: On the internet, there are big data related 
to emergency care information, news feeds, and articles from 
medical journals. 
1.2.3 BIG DATA ANALYTICS (BDA) 
Applied to very large and complex data sets, BDA is the application of 
advanced statistical techniques. Data sets can include structured, semi-
structural, and unstructured information, as well as information from a 
wide range of sources and sizes ranging from tens of terabytes to zettabytes 
in size. BDA is a type of advanced analytics that uses large amounts of data 
which entails complex applications that use analytics systems to power 
elements like statistical models, regression methods, and what-if analysis. 
BDA [8] systems and applications can help businesses make data-driven 
decisions that enhance business outcomes. Increased marketing effi-
ciency, new sales opportunities, client personalization, and operational 
performance are all possible advantages. These advantages may provide 
strategic advantages over competitors with the right approach. Healthcare, 
consumer applications, manufacturing companies, banking and various 
technologies utilize BDA for future trend analysis and customer satisfac-
tion. Figure 1.4 shows the usage of big data across different industries.

1.2.3.1 HEALTHCARE BIG DATA ANALYSIS 
With clinical information, healthcare providers are able to dispense 
medications and make clinical decisions with higher precision, removing 
the guesswork that is sometimes associated with therapy and resulting in 
lower costs and improve quality of care. BDA has widely been used to 
help in the delivery of treatment and disease discovery. However, some 
fundamental problems inherent in the big data paradigm continue to 
obstruct adoption and research growth in this field. BDA is capable of 
enhancing patient-centered services, including early detection of disease 
outbreaks, novel insights into disease processes, and the monitoring of 
the effectiveness of medical and healthcare facilities. Big data is also in 
high demand in healthcare, owing to rising expenditures in countries such 
as the United States. According to McKinsey research, “with nearly 20 
years of continuous growth, healthcare spending is predicted to account 
for 17.6% of GDP – more than $600 billion dollars more than the countries 
expected GDP and size.” 
The following are the number of services for healthcare data analytics:

Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
• Determine daily revenues of patients so that staffing can be managed 
properly; 
• Take advantage of electronic medical records (EHRs); 
• Make real-time alerts available; 
• Aid patients in cultivating a better relationship with their health; 
• Make better educated strategic decisions by utilizing health data; 
• Evidence-based medicine; 
• Predictive analytics; 
• Genomic analytics; 
• Fraud reduction and improved data security; 
• Use telemedicine to help people; 
• Integrate medical imaging to obtain a more comprehensive view of 
the situation; 
• Personnel management and smart staffing; 
• Learning and growth; 
• Advanced disease and risk management; 
• Supply chain management; 
• New cures and breakthroughs are being developed. 
BDA is the analysis of big, diversified, complicated, dynamic, low-cost 
data sets in order to give tailored services. BDA’s ability to convert data into 
data-rich judgments and deliver knowledgeable solutions to challenges in 
a variety of sectors. The use of BDA in healthcare has been investigated in 
several studies [6]. There has recently been a controversy in the literature 
over the use of BDA in healthcare [7]. Healthcare analytics solutions 
demand rigorous design and validation when patient safety, standards 
of healthcare, security, and evidence-based treatment are all on the line. 
While existing development techniques have been used to enforce solution 
design and analysis projects, it is important to consider how an effective 
extrapolation of the design correlates to more public understanding and 
observational method creativity. Researchers should be expected to rise in 
activities that enhance both research and clinical procedure. 
1.2.3.2 CATEGORIES OF HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS 
There are four categories of health analytics: descriptive analytics diag­
nostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Figure 1.5 
shows the different types of healthcare analysis techniques. 

 
 
 
 
14 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
FIGURE 1.5 Types of data analytics. 
While they’re all interconnected and build on one another, therefore I 
grouped them into groups. The level of complexity and resources required 
rises as you proceed from the most basic to the most complicated types 
of analytics. Simultaneously, the level of added value and comprehension 
rises is shown in Figure 1.6. 
FIGURE 1.6 Difficulty vs. value. 
Source: Adapted from Ref. [12]. 
1. Descriptive Analytics: It is the initial sort of data analysis. It is 
the basis of analysis of all data. In today’s corporate world, it is the 
most basic and pervasive application of data. Descriptive analysis 

 
15 
Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
provides a solution by offering a response to the inquiry “what 
happened” to the previous data in the form of dashboards. Descrip-
tive analytics is used to investigate the effects of various healthcare 
decisions on quality of service, clinical trials, and outcomes [10]. 
2. Diagnostic Analytics: It is a subset of business intelligence that 
examines data or materials to determine the cause of an event. 
Some of the methods employed include drill-down, data explora-
tion, data mining, and associations. Analysts pick data sources that 
will aid them in interpreting the outcomes during the discovery 
process. Drilling down entails concentrating on a certain aspect of 
the data or a certain widget. Data mining is a process for retrieving 
useful information from vast amounts of unstructured data that is 
performed automatically [11]. Finding consistent patterns in data 
can also help to accumulate information. 
3. Predictive Health Analytics: Because they concentrate on the 
usage of data rather than just statistics, predictive health analytics 
are more complicated than simple descriptive analytics. It uses 
historical data and indicators to forecast future performance. 
When compared to traditional business techniques, predictive 
analytics using large datasets helps to improve the customer expe-
rience while also enhancing the outcomes. It aids in the analysis 
of massive volumes of transactional and unstructured data at once, 
resulting in conclusions that aid in the prediction of the future. In 
the event of an epidemic illness breakout, a pharmacist may need 
to forecast how much of a medicine to stock. Patients’ length of 
stay; patients who might choose surgery; people for whom surgery 
is unlikely to be beneficial or who might suffer difficulties might 
all be anticipated and studied using huge amounts of previously 
collected data. 
4. Prescriptive Analysis: It was named one of the hype cycle’s tech-
nological innovations by the Gartner Group in 2013, and it has 
since gotten a lot of attention in the corporate sector [12]. Prescrip-
tive analysis is a type of data analysis methodology that provides 
predictions and perspective information. The use of hybrid data, 
which includes both qualitative and quantitative data types, 
combining forecasts and prescriptions, taking into consideration 

 
 
 
 
 
16 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
all possible complications, and employing evolutionary algorithms 
that can be easily customized to each case, in addition to the need 
for consistent and effective feedback, all are critical to the success 
of prescriptive analytics. Because they focus on the use of infor­
mation rather than just statistics, predictive health analytics are 
more complicated than simple descriptive analytics. Descriptive 
analytics uses data visualization extensively to answer specific 
queries or find treatment patterns, giving a more complete view of 
evidence-based clinical practice. They allow businesses to manage 
operational content (info that is updated in real-time or near real-
time) as well as collect all sensory information from people. This 
methodology can assist in establishing a better balance of capability 
and cost by detecting previously unnoticed trends in patients, such 
as tendencies associated with hospital hospitalizations [11]. 
1.2.3.3 OTHER TECHNIQUES FOR DATA ANALYSIS IN HEALTHCARE 
1. Fusion and Integration of Data: The insights are more efficient 
and perhaps more accurate than if they were created from a single 
source of data by utilizing a collection of techniques that analyze 
and integrate data from numerous sources and solutions. 
2. Data Mining: It is a typical approach used in BDA to extract 
patterns from massive data sets using a combination of statistics 
and machine learning methods inside database administration. 
When consumer data is mined to discover which segments are 
most likely to respond to an offer, here is an example. 
3. Machine Learning: which is well-known in the field of artificial 
intelligence (AI), is also utilized for data analysis. It is a branch of 
computer science that uses computer algorithms to generate data-
driven assumptions. It makes forecasts that human analysts would 
be unable to make. 
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This data analysis tool, 
which is a subfield of computer science, AI, and linguistics, 
employs algorithms to analyze human language. 

 
 
17 
Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
5. Statistics: Within surveys and experiments, this methodology is 
used to gather, organize, and interpret data. 
1.2.3.4 CHALLENGES OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS (BDA) IN HEALTHCARE 
Methods for managing and analyzing big data in healthcare are constantly 
being improved, particularly for real-time data streaming, acquisition, 
integration, and analytics utilizing Machine Learning and predictive 
methods. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can be better utilized with 
the help of data visualization in healthcare. Valid information gathering, 
security, data standardization, data storage, and data transfers are the 
significant obstacles that the healthcare business faces. Governance and 
ownership concerns, data analyst skill gaps, data errors, quality assurance, 
and real-time analytics are all examples of managerial challenges. The 
vital challenges faced by the healthcare industry in real-time implementa­
tion of BDA are discussed in further sections. 
1.3 UNSTRUCTURED AND UNRELIABLE ORIGIN OF DATA 
Patients generate a large amount of data that is difficult to acquire and 
manage using typical EHR formats. When it comes to handling massive 
data, the adoption of EMR becomes tough, especially when it comes 
to healthcare providers without a solid data organization. For clinically 
relevant information, including claims, billing, and clinical analytics, a 
single code must be maintained. To express the essential clinical ideas, 
medical coding systems such as current procedural terminology (CPT) and 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standards were developed 
[13]. Inconsistent formats, unprocessed and unorganized datasets, and a 
lack of transparency are some of the major obstacles in dealing with data. 
Cleaning of data on a regular basis can be done manually or automatically 
using a variety of customized algorithms to achieve high levels of correct­
ness and integrity. 
1.3.1 QUALITY OF DATA 
Another problem in large data analytics is data diversity. Big data in health­
care is considerably less informative using traditional technologies due to 

 
18 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
its enormous size and very heterogeneous character. High-performance 
computing clusters connected to grid computing infrastructures are the 
most frequent platforms for running the development environment that 
aids big data processing. 
1.3.2 STORAGE 
One of the main issues is storing massive amounts of data, yet many 
businesses are comfortable with storing data within their own facilities. 
Controlling security, access, and availability are just a few of the benefits. 
The use of IT infrastructure for cloud-based storage is a better solution, 
which most healthcare organizations have chosen. Organizations must 
select cloud partners that are aware of the importance of healthcare-
specific compliance and security concerns. Furthermore, cloud storage 
has reduced upfront costs, faster recovery procedures, and is easier to 
expand. Corporations can also take a hybrid framework for data storage, 
which may be the most adaptable option for providers with variable access 
to data and storage requirements. The technologies of wireless edge 
computing, cloudlets, and fog computing can be used in IoT to perform 
big data processing and analytics closer to the data source. 
1.3.3 SECURITY OF DATA 
To protect data from hackers and spoofing attacks, healthcare firms make 
data security as a top priority. Found traces of a number of vulnerabilities, 
a checklist of technical safeguards for protected health information (PHI) 
was created. Such standards, known as Health Information Privacy and 
Security Rules, assist enterprises with data storage, transfer, authentica­
tion mechanisms, and access, integrity, and auditing controls. Anti-virus 
software that is up to date, firewalls, encrypting sensitive data and multi-
factor authentication are all common security precautions that can save a 
lot of frustration. 
1.3.4 IMPACT OF ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The use of Big Data in healthcare poses significant ethical and legal 
considerations based on the subjective nature of the data contained. The 
risk of compromising individual privacy autonomy, as well as the influence 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
19 
Applications of the Internet of Things and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
on the public’s demand for transparency, confidence, and tolerance, are all 
moral and professional problems when using Big Data. As a result, any 
institution that uses Big Data in the health sector must create affirmative 
regulations to protect personal health data in terms of confidentiality, 
security, and privacy, while simultaneously guaranteeing that scientific 
discoveries benefit from open data usage for the community’s benefit. 
1.4 CONCLUSION 
This chapter presents an overview of IoT and Big Data applications in 
connected healthcare systems, with a particular emphasis on the use of data 
analytics. The importance of big Data analysis for maintaining the database 
and records of patients with varied diseases being discussed. The principle 
of big data in smart healthcare systems depends on various information, 
and this information can be used for predictive analysis of the occurrence 
of pandemic events. A large amount of medical data is dispersed over a 
variety of different platforms requires engineered solutions for integration 
of multiple system information and its implementation. The use of busi­
ness intelligence in integrated healthcare system can be used for prediction 
of pandemic diseases, early warnings of occurrence of diseases thereby 
therapeutic solutions can be provided to raise the standard of human life.

ABSTRACT 
Internet of things (IoT) is a significant emerging topic of economic signifi­
cance, social significance, and technical significance. Our daily products, 
like durable goods, consumer products, cars and trucks, industrial compo­
nents, sensors, etc., are being paired with robust Internet connectivity 
capabilities of data analytics for a smooth operation that will transform 
our daily life, and the way we work, lead, and move. The concept of 
combining computers and networks for daily devices like monitors and 
mobile phones has existed for decades now. Not only modern technology 
and market trends, but also several other industries are adopting IoT in 
their daily work process for the more smooth progress of work, thus 
bringing the IoT more deeply to the real world. One such large industry 
is the construction industry. More than about 16% of the nation’s working 
population depends on its livelihood in the construction industry. Over 
30 million people employ under the Indian construction industry, and it 
creates assets worth more than 300 billion. It almost contributes about 
5% to the GDP of the country and 78% of gross capital creation. It is 
beginning to attract huge attention now a day in the construction industry. 
IoT devices, mobiles, and sensors are collecting job site data in a more 
efficient, affordable, and effective way than ever imaginable, with ease in 

 
22 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
work. In this recent concept, IoT is advancing the possibilities in various 
areas of application for smart construction. IT-based construction works 
are one of the prime and one of the most conservative industries in terms 
of adapting new methods or technologies. From a civil engineering point 
of view, we can assure that the use of IoT in the construction industry will 
simplify, to a considerable degree, the work. This chapter enlightens the 
knowledge of using digital technologies to transform construction work 
into a smart one. The fields where IoT can be applied for smooth as well as 
the rapid advancement of the construction procedure are discussed herein. 
There are actually huge challenges identified via some brief literature 
review, and the solution to them is delivered. In this era of digitalization, 
it’s high time we apply IoT in our construction industry. At the moment, 
emerging countries, such as India, need rapid infrastructure and building 
growth. The solution to it aims to employ IoT technologies to accelerate 
building. Not only that it will make the industry smooth, but it will also 
help in increasing employment, business, and enrollment, and as a whole, 
the economy of our country. We have also gone through the feasibility of 
IoT so that the construction industry remains the largest industry in this 
world. 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
The IoT links intelligent devices in your house and clever devices outside 
your home. The intermediary is mostly cloud-based, the link. Some 
building tools and appliances are clever enough to be monitored with a 
cloud app, and more businesses are looking for a way to build IoT and the 
cloud [1]. 
“The IoT enables objects to be sensed or remotely controlled via the 
current network infrastructures, providing ways to integrate the real envi­
ronment in computing networks, improving performance, precision, and 
cost-effectiveness, in addition to reducing human interference,” said the 
Global. 
As IoT is expanded with sensors and drive units, the platform becomes 
an example of cyber-physical networks that also include technologies such 
as intelligent grid systems, automated power plants, intelligent houses, 
intelligent mobility, and intelligent cities.

IoT in the Construction Industry 
Unmanneed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are benefiting from their popularity 
as modern vehicles. Monitoring and monitoring of huge building projects 
covering enormous areas, particularly drones, are facilitated by UAVs 
[2–4]. In addition, automated dump trucks and excavators are tested for 
the purpose of limiting human vulnerability to dangerous working condi­
tions in different projects. Examples include Autonomous TMA Truck, 
Smart Trucks by Komatsu. Manual monitoring of vital equipment status 
and position on a building site requires a lot of time and is susceptible 
to human error. The design/project manager is very comfortable with 
fitting trackers for these vital properties. The system monitoring system 
IoT facilitates the user management, cost control, and decision-making 
of smarter equipment for building firms. The collection of documentation 
data and devices does not provide operational details easily to administra­
tors [3–5]. IoT’s beauty is that smart wireless networks are a cost-effective 
choice, even for small businesses and short-term ventures. 
The construction industry remains among the last sector to apply 
the internet of things (IoT) in its processes and activities. But as already 
known, “better late than never,” the industry has started implementing IoT 
in various aspects, such as site monitoring, machine control, fleet manage­
ment, and so on. The latest estimates suggest that the time before IoT 
becomes a must-have tool in the building is only a matter of time. Emerging 
innovations can help to improve waste disposal [6] and the well-being 
of employees, reduce building costs, and help properties fit prospective 
customers. IoT uses internet sensors that are generally installed around 
work sites or can be used by workers. These IoT construction devices 
can collect data on construction activities, their result, and conditions and 
send it to the central dashboard in which to inform decisions the data is 
analyzed [7]. 
The sector is seeing an increase in operating complexity, and construc­
tion firms have grown and expanded globally and in the form of proj­
ects they perform since the beginning of this decade. It requires project 
managers in different locations at the same time, thus optimizing asset 
life cycle management and managing programs in order to minimize addi­
tional costs and to avoid future delays. Due to the use of digital solutions 
such as worker wear sensors and hardhats, wearables that track dangerous 
building materials, sensors that monitor and alert workers should enter 
insecure locations, IoT is able to make places more secure by connection

on the construction site, for instance in construction with the ability to 
substantially minimize any kind of accident [8]. 
Effective reporting is possible by the connection through monitors, 
CCTV cameras, and even drones to construction sites all data are redi­
rected to a central office, where recommendations about where a building 
project is located, and the changes required to keep the project underway 
are taken. Material sensors and RFID tags can facilitate automatic 
workflows, constructive material purchase and equipment maintenance. 
Sensors on-site facilities often track levels of use and may highlight 
possible problems in proactive maintenance – buildings that lack supplies 
or need maintenance for equipment previously entailed expensive delays. 
IoT assists in maintaining programs [9, 10]. 
The use of IoT devices could increase the control of resources at 
building sites significantly. If one has chips connecting all your computers, 
personnel, and supplies to the internet, one can automatically find them. 
There are substantial future costs and gains in time. IoT instruments will 
constantly provide updates on the conditions both at constructed and at 
under-construction locations through sensors strewn over a construction 
site. Sensors may detect such things as irregular movements on a machine 
piece which means that it needs to be repaired. One can identify moisture 
increases, which can alert the inspection teams about moisture problems. 
The construction industry being highly saturated, construction project 
managers and engineers need to beat the market competitors by both 
quality and time. In the case of both built and sub-construction places [11, 
12], IoT instruments are continuously updated through the sensors on the 
building site. Sensors can sense unusual motions on a part of the system, 
meaning it must be fixed. High water levels can be identified and can alert 
the inspection teams of issues with moisture. 
Computing-assisted design (CAD) helps people to transcend physics 
and drawings to a digital world where 2D or 3D models, structures, and 
more are created. The CAD and IoT merger of virtual reality (VR) head­
sets are a growing example. They complement the workflows of engineers 
by allowing quick returns to save time and resources [13]. 
Related assistance is offered in the architecture industry through 
building information modeling (BIM). Until instructing teams to assemble 
them, the project managers will evaluate simulated scaffolding configu­
rations or let customers see computerized constructions before they do. 
BIM makes it possible for all stakeholders to enhance coordination and 

 
 
 
 
25 
IoT in the Construction Industry 
teamwork. Entities support the strategy of programs before they break 
through, frequently proposing new ways of doing their work and seeing if 
their positions lead to ultimate progress. In engineering and similar fields, 
CAD and IoT were not always commonly used together [11–13]. This is 
evolving today, and for the BIM and IoT there is a similar change. One 
choice is to import IoT sensor information to supplement BIM content. If 
the sensor displays current energy demand, building management will use 
those numbers to assess how they can change effectively and exclude those 
who would not perform properly. Builders can perform better than ever, 
reduce the number of people required for complicated tasks, and lower 
labor costs, with the use of IoT-enabled teamwork tools. For example, 
drones that are installed with advanced 3D mapping capability will search 
the job site and feed the information into a BIM device that produces exact 
3D work models. These templates can be easily revised by the job manager 
and notified of the updates immediately to both employees and managers. 
It also helps stakeholders to collect up-to-date progress updates and videos 
of the building site by capturing data on the work site and posting them in 
real-time to an IoT website, enables them to monitor the status of a project 
and to make changes, if necessary, to monitor the project [14]. 
Even if 87% of shoppers take a green call, market research reveals that 
only 33% allow green shopping successfully. For two main reasons: cost 
and convenience, the purchasing behavior does not satisfy the consumer’s 
request. When it comes to a big-ticket construction initiative, eco-building 
events are the perfect distribution channels. And IoT allows the public to 
deliver what they need. The environmental movement caused a flurry of 
interest about greener building activities. The IoT advantages are built to 
create a smart facility which knows when the construction is out of busi­
ness. Automatically shut down unnecessary processes that save electricity 
and natural resources. Smart window designs provide a smarter operation 
than basic remote control or blinds that are time activated [15]. As IoT 
touches windows, it results in a device that detects natural sunlight or 
temperature parameters, and automatically closes lathes to save energy as 
things get cold or start to heat up. 
The results of a building project depend primarily on whether the 
materials necessary for the completion are available [16]. A lack of funds 
could hinder progress, but machinery that collapses or gets robbed could 
also become misplaced. It avoids such catastrophes by using the IoT in 
building. Managers can also get data on different platforms in real-time. If 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
a team leader uses an IoT system to monitor a geofencing element, virtual 
borders for tools and equipment can be created. Such features prohibit 
anyone from leaving something inadvertently following a changeover or 
from deliberately misusing equipment by removing it from the site. 
Confidence in IoT will also help in the control of resources by alerting 
the public of anomalies until they trigger faults in the machine. Tempera­
ture, fluid speed, acceleration, and more information can be collected 
by sensors, enabling managers to respond more effectively to signs of 
problems. In connection, if an operator of an equipment finds something 
odd and reports it to an operator, he can promptly examine the problem by 
carefully examining the related information. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) with its subset machine learning (ML), these 
two have their capacity to manipulate data, can also play an alarming role 
in construction and make it ideally suitable to the industry, becoming a 
tangible benefit. Building firms may use of AI and machine learning for 
monitoring information on stock level, scheduling information, and even 
on data obtained for projects, information on weather or other disturbances, 
to help advise and prevent possible errors or problems in previous projects. 
They allow you to properly evaluate time frames and get a better view of 
the amount of people and other resources available for projects [17]. 
Technology may make advances on properties and programs based on 
analytical insights from AI or machine learning so that it learns that it can 
take precautionary steps as parameters shift ‘automatically’ (Figure 2.1). 
FIGURE 2.1 All data obtained is processed via a communication layer. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
27 
IoT in the Construction Industry 
The IoT is staying here. It’s the future, and it’s the present for many. 
In the building industry, consumer demands have been boosted by the 
success of technologies that allows builder contractors to more effectively 
offer projects based on their own historical data and to achieve their tasks 
quicker, more reliably, and efficiently using intelligent embedded tech­
nology [15, 17]. 
Data had previously been obtained manually from sensors and thresholds 
crossed were frequently not detected until the harm was done first. Products 
that track ambient conditions at a low cost and warn when limits are crossed 
have been available in real-time. In order to ensure the surface conditions, 
satisfy the floor manufacturer’s specifications, there are also options for 
measuring the humidity and temperature of cement floor plates as well. 
Monitoring of the worksite is another increasing IoT application. Site 
administrators will track their activities from a single dashboard by equip­
ping employees with low-powered IoT sensors. The sensors capture and 
relay data visually, which alerts monitors to unhealthy patterns of activity 
or efficiency delays. The potential to capture large volumes of sensor 
data is one of the leading IoT applications for building and the program 
turns the knowledge obtained into operating observations that nothing can 
compare with speed and precision. 
Constructing new infrastructure in crowded urban areas also involves 
working together with existing structures that may be affected by 
development. There are now automatic deformation control systems, 
which can provide data 24/7 until configured. Intervals of measurements 
historically listed in days can now be set to minutes between periods. If 
the deformation levels determined by the record engineer are violated, 
staff is automatically notified and work may be halted and remedial steps 
taken, depending on the situation. Coordinated work on crowded roads 
will provide practical problems for the events that affect public right of 
way in congested urban environments. This refers to the completion of 
such activities beyond regular operating hours. However, as more people 
choose to not only work but live in the center of town, it is difficult to do 
this job without interrupting residents. Solutions will now not only warn 
us to exceed the threshold, but also of the importance of monitoring noise 
in order to determine the root problem and take appropriate action. 
IoT may help decrease waste generation in building. Any industries 
also use sensor systems to track the garbage level on site. Certain devices 
can minimize cutting or molding waste and debris. There is also a program 

 
 
 
 
 
 
28 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
for waste control to measure the exact number of materials used to avoid 
waste generation. Finally, third-party agencies provide resources for the 
collection of data in real-time to help companies deal more effectively 
with their waste [8–10]. 
IoT data may support companies analyzing and improving their 
operational processes to further maximize performance, productivity, 
and, as a result, profitability on a larger, strategic scale. Given how IoT is 
transforming companies in all other industries, there is no doubt that IoT 
is transforming companies from construction and the industry. Building 
firms must, however, find ways to make use of IoT and participate in pilot 
projects to benefit from the early adoption. 
Poor maintenance activities also lead to higher project completion costs. 
Outdated technological technologies don’t make it possible for company 
owners to effectively track all assets, control equipment efficiency and 
prepare up-to-date upgrades, plan maintenance stops. The integration of 
IoT into building provides administrators with a continuous stream of real-
time data that is handy for all types of decision-making — job planning, 
distribution of resources, monitoring, investment negotiations, etc. Access 
to the related data on request will enhance coordination between teams, 
protect teams against unfounded decisions, and enable asset monitoring in 
real-time [8–11]. 
Unforeseen modifications are characteristic of a project of building. 
In addition to helping project supervisors see unexpected problems in the 
corner, the IoT gives them an insight into how to respond. Although IoT is 
not vaccinating an organization against a flat-footed capture, the potential 
for a surprise to erase a carefully planned strategy can be significantly 
reduced. 
2.2 DEFINITION AND ARCHITECTURE OF INTERNET OF THINGS 
(IOT) 
According to a group of research projects in Europe, they quoted, “IoT is 
a unique part of perspective internet and may be regarded as a dynamic 
global collection of connections with self-armature potentials customary 
for standard and interoperable messaging etiquette where physical and 
implied “things” have an identity, material impute, with implicit disposi­
tion as well as the smart interface, which are completely integrated into the 
data network” [4–6, 8] (Figure 2.2). 

 
 
29 
IoT in the Construction Industry 
FIGURE 2.2 Consents of the internet of things. 
2.3 TECHNOLOGY, SOFTWARE, AND HARDWARE 
Before defining the technology, it is critical to analyze the vision of the 
IoT, which must fulfill the interaction between humans and the environ­
ment. The IoT architecture should be built on top of a network frame that 
integrates cabled and mobile technologies in a transparent and unified 
manner. Radiofrequency identification (RFID), Short domain mobile tech­
nology can fulfill the IoT ideal of communication between the physical 
world and the Internet and Sensor networks. Nowadays, more research 
is going on wireless network technologies, which have the capability to 
deliver inconspicuous wire-free communication. Various technology must 
be provided for the collection of databases about the physical thing (envi­
ronment) and effective object monitoring. The application and interaction 
of physical things and the Internet should be accomplished by installing 
proper software to manage the network’s resources, devices, and distrib­
uted services. In the case of failure of the system, the software should 
control and predict self-configuration and auto-recovery. After defining 
the proper technology and software, hardware selection becomes a diffi­
cult task in IoT. The research still is required to develop hardware having 
radical, a low-energy, multi-purpose framework on a component that will 

 
 
30 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
have the ability of self-adaptiveness and self-organization. The dedicated 
algorithm is used as a component with the chipset of hardware system with 
an ultra-low power very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits [1–3]. 
2.4 LITERATURE REVIEW 
When it comes to data-gathering connected to industries and cities, most 
operations will undergo exponential development in the next years. 
Sensors that are highly connected and networked will be widely used 
in a variety of applications. Automation of industrial processes, and, in 
a larger sense, automation of processes involving all social actors, has 
resulted in a widespread understanding of tremendous achievements in 
“cyber-physical systems” and IoT. Cyber-physical systems are the conse­
quence of providing computational and communicational capabilities to 
physical components. The use of CPS in industrial sectors such as manu­
facturing, logistics, data, and municipal administration are all possibilities 
with significant economic, societal, and environmental implications, as 
these systems may generate pivotal opportunities in fields such as energy 
interfaces. When it comes to the IoT and Automation, the architecture, 
engineering, and construction (AEC) sector has generally moved at a 
slower pace than other more automated and industrialized areas. The rate 
of acceptance of such technology has been slow. All AEC main players 
recognize the enormous room for development in areas like sustainability, 
risk management, clean energy, and infrastructure management. Similarly, 
one of the most significant potentials for growth in civil engineering is 
automation innovation. 
In some domains, the use of sensors integrated within city or rural 
infrastructures is well-progressed, while in others, it is still in its infancy. 
There are numerous examples of physical/chemical sensor integration in 
water management, energy efficiency, and transportation. Nonetheless, 
construction process automation or sensor embeddedness in structures is 
not yet commonplace. The use of sensors within structures is confined to 
select (though numerous) examples of Structural Health Monitoring that 
are highly controlled and rigorous. It is fair to say that the vast collection 
of data from sensors in structures is still in its early stages. 
If you’re reading this book, it’s very likely that you’ve already heard 
the terms IoT with a web of things (WoT). Hopefully, you are looking 
forward to understanding what this trend is all about, or you have already

IoT in the Construction Industry 
known the importance of this topic and the popularity of same. Maybe you 
are a civil engineer and realize what IoT could mean for your industry, 
and you would like to gain the hard technical skills needed to build web-
connected products and services. 
We have already discussed what IoT means, what new types of appli­
cations and scenarios IoT enables, and how this can change the technology 
and business landscape for the coming years in Construction Industry. This 
chapter will cover in brief all the web technologies and tools that will help 
you make the IoT a reality for the construction industry (Figure 2.3). On 
the other hand, we believe that starting with some background will help 
you better understand what the IoT really is and how you can use it in your 
own projects, not just stick to the superficial and stereotypical descriptions 
of it [2–6]. 
Two decades ago, it only existed in science-fiction novels and books, 
where everybody could feel the world through digitalization. They could 
use sensors, analyze, store, or exchange information on mobile, laptop, or 
desktop. Today, those scenarios increasingly became smart things. A smart 
item is a physical object that has been digitally enhanced with one or more 
of the following features: 
• Sensors-simulation; 
• Actuators (displays, sound, motors, and so on); 
• Computation; 
• Communication interfaces.

2.5 IOT IN IT ENABLE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
IoT in construction is basically based on utilizing of internet-connected 
sensors in the job sites or in-situ or may be worn by laborers while they 
are on duty. For construction, IoT devices can collect certain types of data 
about the performance of laborers and workers, and activity of the same 
with circumstances on the construction site, and then send the data to a 
central dashboard, where it will be examined to aid decision-making. 
Occasionally, since the last two decades, the devices with internet 
connections in them were generally computers and mobile phones. 
However, now is recent time, with a gadget known as a chip, a wide range 
of sensors can be quickly changed and inexpensively upgraded (similar 
to a subscriber identity module (SIM) card). The name “internet of things 
(IoT)” is used since it is so small and insignificant. It is now possible to 
connect various gadgets to a central database, from the smartwatches that 
most people wear nowadays that measure heart rate to temperature sensors 
and vibration monitors. This means that a tiny gadget or machine can 
monitor many more features of a place in real-time. This is how the IoT is 
beneficial and popular these days, with significant consequences [8–10]. 
2.6 IOT IN CIVIL ENGINEERING 
Civil engineering is, without a doubt, the most ancient engineering subject. 
Even though history claims it dates to the third century. Archimedes, a 
Greek mathematician who flourished between 287 and 212 B.C., is best 
known for inventing the screw, which allowed projects like the Pont du 
Gard, a Roman aqueduct, to be built. 
There are numerous courses and curriculum in civil engineering 
education connected to a wide range of subjects, including structure, 
geotechnical, mechanics, hydraulics, geosciences, transportation, building 
materials, construction, survey, and so on. 
Following that, these streams are linked to highly professional subjects 
like structural design, soil mechanics, fluid mechanics, water supply engi­
neering, hydraulic structures, building foundations, bridge engineering, 
highway, airport, and railway engineering, drinking water and wastewater 
treatment, structural analysis, and so on. Figure 2.4 illustrates some of the 
foundational fields of study in which curricula are defined. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33

FIGURE 2.4 Application of IoT in civil engineering fields. 
Talking about education in civil engineering, there are very few experi­
ences in which the above-mentioned technologies are used that can be 
found in the literature. 
2.7 HOW CAN WE APPLY IOT IN CIVIL ENGINEERING? 
The connection between the physical and the virtual worlds has bought 
new levels of ecosystems into our society. The IoT or ubiquitous sensors 
used in urban areas are only a fraction of those ecosystems. IoT has 
intense consequences for new generations, and as a result, in fields 
like education, trends, and other schools of thought, IoT is emerging, 
particularly in as robotics and control engineering kingdom. However, 
thanks to these trends in the construction industry to control are also 
making a new role. The curricula of civil engineering are infused with 
commonplace strategies related to automation, physical-to-digital 
bridges, the systematic use of monitoring devices, and human-computer

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
interfaces. Traditionally, the students of civil engineering in classrooms 
have described the problems of civil engineering by using classic theory 
involving a significant amount of mathematical background as well as 
a thorough understanding of the phenomena. These classic theories are 
generally been derived from experimental observations from laboratories 
by civil engineers decades before, establishing various formulae, results, 
and research. But the development of single or multivariable experiments 
associated with these fields is still under of the greatest experiences for 
students at diploma, bachelor, and especially master levels. Similarly, 
numerical simulations are still increasingly used in education. However, 
despite of the direct link between the physical and virtual principle in 
which the curriculum is based, few educational programs in recent times, 
found in some universities, provide bridges between the existing gap 
between the physical and virtual world. Therefore, the educators are now 
starting to face a complex challenge in the field of civil engineering. On 
the one hand, the continuing trends in monitoring, control, automation, 
the construction of intelligent cities and the IoT will eventually shape the 
professional sector of civil in the coming years. However, the study of 
the use of sensors, electronics, programming, and other technologies that 
represent the cornerstones of this transformation lack in the curriculum of 
civil engineering for the students. 
Our first application will be dealing with the physical-to-digital 
interfaces development in real practical problems of civil engineering 
using mobile phones. These problems are generally reproducible in 
educational facilities generally found in schools of civil engineering 
worldwide. 
The experiment developed in traditional civil engineering in labo­
ratories include the measurement of torsion, pressure, stress and strain, 
discharge, water levels, material characterization, soil tests, concrete tests, 
deflection of beams, aggregate value tests, etc. These magnitudes are 
measured in the research labs with great precision by means of tested and 
specialized equipment. Sophisticated user interfaces developed typically 
by the hardware providers allow gathering and visualizing information in 
a meaningful way. But there are often some disadvantages in few places; 
firstly, the cost of these hardware laboratory machineries is too much; 
secondly, the limitation of facilities in research labs takes place in some 
newly opened colleges, etc., thus the proper tool of education being not 
available to the vast majority of students. 

 
35 
IoT in the Construction Industry 
However, the costs and accessibility of electronic devices have 
decreased remarkably in recent years. There is available technology that 
may smoothen the reproduction of traditional laboratory experiences by 
a number of students to a reasonable extent, in terms of accuracy and 
precision. 
In some courses, it may be an ideal scenario, the one in which student 
develops IoT applications easily with correct use of sensors, microcon-
trollers, and visualization. 
 Firstly, array vast in number, of sensors, are both technically 
and economically available and accessible. Some of the physical 
magnitudes, such as distance, light, discharge, pressure, tempera-
ture, humidity, noise, acceleration, etc., can be measured with the 
help of these devices. The students of civil engineering are gener-
ally acquainted with how these devices transform the variations of 
physical magnitude in variations related to civil. Thus, the theory 
and behavior of analog and digital sensors need to be explained 
theoretically and practically. 
 Secondly, the prototyping of electronic boards has become such 
popular device these days that provide a simulation interface for 
beginners. The mechanics of the interfaces are quite similar, even 
if these prototyping boards may not give the same or accurate 
performance that professional equipment used in laboratories. As 
civil engineering students have mostly been exposed to practical 
experiences involving electronics, the basic concepts of electricity 
and signals (such as analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)) need to 
be described in class to the civil engineering students beforehand. 
The above two points can easily be introduced to IoT in the civil 
engineering field through their curriculum, thus making it totally appli-
cable in the near future. The main objective of the proposed learning 
environment is to introduce a closure of the existing physical-to-digital 
gap among civil engineering students. This environment consists of an 
immediate experimental experience in which all students are provided 
with a brief and necessary tool and with a collaborative working space. 
Expert educators and technicians should be available in the schools for 
help at particular pre-scheduled hours for clearing any quarry of the 
students.

2.8 OBSTACLES OF IOT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
Firstly, an anonymous person or an outsider, someone belonging to a rival 
company, may find out if a hacker can gain access to a company’s IoT data­
base. It may be a goldmine of crucial and authentic data. Criminals may 
benefit from a list of all your machinery’s locations that are now placed 
or where valuable items are stored. Many people, including labor orga­
nizations, may protest on privacy grounds, citing worries about tracking 
workers’ physical movements. Because most IoT devices are inexpensive, 
many job site owners will have to persuade their client offices that they 
are worthwhile. When working on smaller locations where all inspections 
can be completed in a matter of minutes, it may seem pointless to invest in 
sensors and learn to utilize a dashboard when the work can be completed 
manually. For the time being, IoT construction solutions are more likely 
to be deployed on large construction and civil engineering projects. The 
effectiveness of sensors is determined on how they are used. When the 
primary risk might not make sense to spend money on moisture sensors. 
Sensors must be intelligently positioned and chosen, and many construc­
tion businesses will face a steep learning curve before reaping the full 
benefits of these instruments. Placing IoT sensors around a facility will not 
fix problems on its own. 
2.9 POTENTIAL USES OF IOT IN CONSTRUCTION 
IoT is already being used in construction companies all around the world. 
The following are a few examples of how IoT can be used in the construc­
tion industry: 
1. Working Conditions That are Safe for Staffs: Practices such as 
wear a wristband or use a clip-on device. If every employee on a 
job site wears a wristband or wears a clip-on device, data on their 
activity and movements can be utilized to detect any accidents or 
unsafe behavior. An example of a New York construction firm that 
provided clip-on IoT devices to workers for their safety. When the 
device is dropped by three feet or more, the chip-on device sends 
an automatic notification to the company’s site safety manager, or 
safety department. 

 
37 
IoT in the Construction Industry 
2. Resource Management Improvement: IoT devices could 
significantly improve resource management on construction sites, 
such as how many hours are wasted searching for materials on 
construction sites, how many liters of fuel are burned by idle 
engines, and how much time laborers are underemployed when 
they could be supporting other tasks, etc. 
 
You can locate all machinery, personnel, and materials promptly if 
they are all chip-connected to the internet. There are considerable 
cost and time savings to be had here. Even monitors placed on a 
truck by an IoT company or a construction company utilizing. IoT 
solutions can track the location and activities of a wide range of 
resources. 
3. Better Upkeeping and Reporting: IoT devices can provide 
constant input about information and circumstances at both 
in-situ and under-construction sites when sensors are attached at 
the construction site. Sensors can detect unusual vibrations on 
machinery that indicate it needs to be repaired, detect rises in 
humidity that might alert your inspection teams to a damp issue, 
and even help prevent fires, as in the case of IoT building construc-
tion business pillar. 
The area at Plan Radar is exciting. The By delivering app already 
functions as an IoT device for construction, providing real-time ticketing 
information for site problems to maintenance employees. However, with 
advancements in IoT sensors, this might be accomplished even more 
quickly. Construction companies are already reaping the benefits of the 
IoT. It is assisting in the following areas: 
• Improving the construction industry’s health and safety; 
• Insurance premiums to be reduced; 
• Reduce squandering and steal; 
• Enhance more proactive (less expensive) maintenance; 
• Increase resource management efficiency.

2.10 FUTURE SCOPE IOT IN IT-BASED CONSTRUCTION 
The motive of operations in which the construction business has devel­
oped is what is called “the IoT platform.” To optimize the process of 
decision-making and achieve the best resource management, employees, 
and fleets, the IoT platform aims at providing manufacturers of equipment 
of construction and end-user contractors with comprehensive analysis 
and also reports on different elements of their works as well as assets. 
Sensors are the key in the building field. Sensors provide all the informa­
tion required to enhance decision-making with the real-time worksite and 
personnel data to be captured. 
The platform offers many extensive details, which may be picked as 
it may be deemed. This allows for effective and cost-efficient alterna­
tives. Virtually any important information may be obtained, from the 
consumption of fuel to the production of equipment, from the maintenance 
services to future forecasts. Moreover, most features are fully adaptable to 
fulfill special contractor requirements (e.g., alarm bell and notifications, 
the layout of the dashboard, CAN-Bus parameters, measurement units, 
languages, etc.). 
Data collected, known as big data, offers several analytical methods: 
1. Descriptive: A thorough account of present conditions and an 
understanding of what has transpired in a particular work setting; 
2. Predictive: To ensure reliable product performance predictions 
and prevent potential malfunctions or injuries from occurring; 
3. Prescriptive: Know how the process and workflow via projects 
and plans that feed the machines are optimized and automatized in 
real-time. 
The main advantages of obtaining bigger data are cost savings and a 
greater understanding of what clients require. 
The IoT is one of the most intriguing new advancements in our sector. 
According to McKinsey, consultants of around $1 trillion on work loca­
tions by 2025. This means that it will become a more widespread aspect 
in the building sector as a whole. The IoT in construction is surely one 
to watch in recent times, with a wide range of applications and growing 
benefits. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
39 
IoT in the Construction Industry 
Smart, networked building equipment can track the way it is utilized. 
By accumulating previous data, the IoT platform will be able to develop 
patterns of information to better understand the demands of customers and 
the environment. In fact, the data acquired from the intelligent goods and 
systems that are connected give precise information on the usage, utiliza­
tion, and ignoring of product features. 
IoT in the IT-based construction industry has the potential effect of 
reducing all kinds of accidents that might take place at work sites using 
digital solutions, like sensors on workers, their movement and position 
can be tracked by the same, clothing, and hardhats used, wearable of the 
staffs that monitor for hazardous materials present in the construction site, 
sensors that will monitor and alert when workers enter unsafe areas in the 
site, etc. The list goes on for ways in which digitalization them and all 
means. IoT can help keep projects moving forward, without making delay 
of completion of project time. 
In the world, IoT, their technologies, digitalization, and data are used 
to improve their activities by construction businesses. Australia is seeing 
a rising tendency towards partnerships with technology suppliers in 
constructing, engineering, and consulting organizations, which are devel­
oping mutually intelligent solutions. The initiative offers advantages such 
as tracking of the flowing of assets and goods in multi-stored buildings 
in real-time, monitoring the total number of persons present on site, and 
providing firms for construction with data for logistics optimization, theft, 
inventory maintenance, and safety risk mitigation. Building may flourish 
with data and digital tools. About 95% of the construction organizations 
now have informed KPMG (audit, tax, and advisory services are provided 
by a global network of professional businesses.) that IoT included in the 
industry are changing their industries fundamentally, while PwC says 
that 98% of construction organizations anticipate digital instruments to 
improve their work efficiency by about 12%. IoT instruments is allowing 
building enterprises to make use of real-time data for assisting them 
flourish in such industry which is famous for the overruns of price, 
expensive equipment, deficiencies of skilled work and increasing short 
project schedules. 
IoT has now been integrated for smart buildings as BIoT (building 
internet of things) focusing on more sustainable buildings focusing on 
multifunctional management console. Smart building aims to create build­
ings with more comfort and lesser expenditure with minimum adversity to

the environment. The benefits of building automation systems go beyond 
energy saving. The development of intelligent buildings will obviously be 
driven by intelligent cities and their intelligent buildings will maximize 
the experience of the residents. Implementing the climate change policy 
will need building efficiency. 
IoT enables to remotely sense objects and control them across 
existing network infrastructures, thereby providing more opportunity 
for the physical world to be integrated directly into computer-based 
systems and improving, in addition to decrease human intervention, 
efficiency, accuracy, and economic benefits. Increasing IoTs via the use 
of sensors and actuators makes it an example of the most generic class 
of cyber-physical systems, technologies such as intelligent networks, 
virtual power stations, using clever households, smart transit, and smart 
cities. 
As already discussed, IoT has immense benefits in the construction 
industry, and there are many more to be identified in the coming years. 
Construction is the type of industry that cannot thrive without the human 
grind. Hence it becomes the responsibility of the construction company or 
the organization to ensure the health and safety of its workers and simulta­
neously be mindful of the profit and reduce waste for better sustainability. 
IoT can help in ensuring all of these for the organization with minimum 
effort and toil. 
As IoT seems to be more omnipresent, the way in which the building 
sector changes has a bigger effect. IoT enables each stakeholder to 
understand what is occurring in every phase of the building process in 
real-time, from design to the actual building, post-construction, and how 
the facility is managed throughout service. As the building business 
evolves at a glacial pace, construction businesses using technology to 
handle common workplace issues successfully and simplify procedures 
profit from higher efficiency and enhanced response to the growing needs 
of the sector. 
IoT in construction has come a long way since its introduction to the 
industry, yet there are certain shortcomings that are yet to be met. Although 
it has already been established that IoT can support the construction 
industry in the best possible way and in the coming days, this could find 
more ways for improvisations in the industry.

ABSTRACT 
Object detection is a key feature needed by the majority of computer and 
robot vision systems. The most recent study in this field has made signifi­
cant strides. During the last few years, there has been a successful increase 
in computer vision research. Part of this success may be attributed to the 
adoption and adaptation of machine learning methods, while others can be 
attributed to the invention of novel representations and models for specific 
computer vision challenges or the development of efficient solutions. 
Object detection is one area that has made significant improvement. As 
a consequence of the enhanced computational capacity of current proces­
sors, progress is being made on a daily basis. More advances like this will 
boost the chances of Object detection and other related operations. Object 
detection, given a collection of object classes, consists of determining the 
location and size of all object instances, if any, that are present in a picture 
or an image in a series (e.g., video). Thus, the goal of an object detector 
is to locate all object instances of one or more provided object classes 

 
44 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
independent of scale, position, posture, camera view, partial occlusions, 
or lighting conditions. Object detection is often the initial stage in many 
computer vision systems since it allows additional information about the 
identified object and the scene to be obtained. Once an object instance 
(e.g., a face, body, thing, etc.) has been detected, it is possible to obtain 
additional information, such as: (i) recognizing the specific instance; (ii) 
tracking the object over an image sequence (e.g., tracking an object in a 
video); and (iii) extracting additional information about the object (e.g., 
determining the subject’s gender). 
It is also possible to: (i) infer the existence or placement of other items 
in the picture (e.g., an obstacle may be near a face and at a comparable 
scale); and (ii) better estimate other information about the scene (e.g., the 
type of setting, etc.). 
In this current manuscript, we discuss how the detection of a single 
object class helps us in detecting and reducing the amount of video analysis 
required to record and detect objects (e.g., animals or birds, etc.) appearing 
in front of the recording device. The single-object detection approach is 
preferred here as, if the algorithm is able to detect a single object precisely, 
then it may be able to detect multiple objects in front of it as well. Since 
the graph of the duration of stay of the object is plotted with respect to the 
single object detected hence it can be inferred if the algorithm can detect 
a single object from a collection of objects, then the graph will also be 
plotted for it accordingly. Thus, a reduction of effort is required to analyze 
video recordings of great length. 
Object detection has been utilized in a wide range of applications. 
Each of these applications has various requirements, such as processing 
time, occlusion resilience, rotation invariance (e.g., in-plane rotations), 
and detection under posture changes. While many applications include 
detecting a single object class (e.g., faces) and from a single perspective 
(e.g., frontal faces), others require detecting numerous object classes 
(vehicles, birds, etc.), or a single class from various viewpoints (e.g., side 
and frontal view of vehicles). Most systems, in general, can detect just a 
single object class given a limited number of perspectives and positions. 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
Vision is an important aspect that is required by computer and robotic 
systems. Object detection plays an important part in achieving this. The 

 
45 
Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
pace of research and development has been high in the field of research 
and development in computer vision in recent years. And, as a result, the 
field of object detection has made progress as well. 
The successful growth of computer vision research has occurred due to 
incorporating machine learning techniques and adjusting accordingly. The 
increased computing power of modern-day processors has played a huge 
part in the contribution of the development of this field. It is projected that 
such developments will lead to the growth of prospects of object detection 
and other allied activities [1]. 
Object detection has vital importance and many other related activities 
or processes are dependent on it. This paragraph will shed light briefly on 
some of them. Detecting the position and span of all instances of objects 
that are there in an image sequence whereby there exists a collection of 
similar object classes is also contained under object detection. Irrespective 
of size, placement, posture, and scene with respect to a camera device, 
partial occlusions, and lighting conditions, the task of an object detector 
is to recognize the presence of one or multiple object classes. Perception 
of a given instance, tracking of the same over the video, information extra 
to the object (e.g., gender), the existence of other objects in the scene, 
evaluation of the scene, etc., are also obtained following the detection of 
the object [1]. 
In this chapter, we go through how object detection can help us record 
and detect items (like animals or birds, etc.) that appear in front of the 
recording device while also minimizing the amount of video analysis 
needed to do so. Here, the single-object detection strategy is recom­
mended because, if the algorithm can accurately identify a single thing, it 
might also be able to identify several objects in front of it. Since the graph 
of the item’s duration of stay is presented in relation to the single object 
discovered, it can be deduced that if the algorithm is able to identify a 
single object among a group of objects, the graph will likewise be plotted 
for it in the appropriate manner. If it can detect one object from a collec­
tion of objects in front of the lens of a camera, then during video analysis 
for editing purposes etc. by professionals the cost of analysis and editing 
reduces as we only focus on extracting and editing only those sections 
of the recordings that have detected objects successfully in front of the 
camera within the time span of deployment of it. Hence, this acts as a cost-
effective measure and improves the productivity of professionals working 
with wildlife recordings.

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
Object detection finds usage acceptance over a range of applica­
tions. Time required for processing, ability to be robust to occlusions, 
rotational constancy, and detection under posture transitions are some 
of the factors upon which the requirements of these applications depend 
upon. The different types of object detection that applications take into 
consideration are single object class detection from a single, detection 
of several object classes, or detection ability of a single class from more 
than one view. Predominantly, most systems could detect a single object 
class from a limited collection of similar views and postures [1]. 
3.2 EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS AND PROPOSALS 
3.2.1 OBSERVATIONS 
The amount of lighting available at a point in time affects the intensi­
ties uniformly all over the image with respect to time (i.e., the overall 
image experiences lightness or darkness due to lighting conditions). In 
a real-life scenario, the camera experiences changing lighting patterns 
with respect to time. Hence, we encounter problems as the proper adjust­
ment of application doesn’t take place according to changing lighting 
conditions. 
Simulation is conducted using an external webcam attached to a laptop 
by varying the lighting conditions. Once the application starts running, 
the video of the scene is captured. When an object appears before the 
webcam, the detection process begins. Initial background subtraction is 
followed by binary thresholding to make the background pixels black and 
the foreground pixels white. The image is then dilated to increase the size 
of the detected object, which is denoted by a rectangular region enclosing 
it. The timestamps of objects appearing and leaving the scene are recorded 
and plotted using a motion graph. This gives an idea of the duration for 
which the detected object was in sight. 
Here, in Figures 3.1–3.4, we can see how lighting conditions affect 
the application that is supposed to record video for long hours. Hence, 
if proper calibration or adjustment of application does not take place, 
it shall become a problem while in use. Here, the change of lighting 
conditions in Figures 3.1–3.4 simulates the day-night and night-day 
transitions.

to detect the face. 
FIGURE 3.2 As soon as the lighting condition improves, the object detection algorithm 
detects the whole window as an object. 
FIGURE 3.3 The application is restarted with good lighting conditions. It is able to detect 
the face.

FIGURE 3.4 The object detection window detects the whole object detection window as 
an object is detected. 
3.2.1.1 IMPROVEMENT DEDUCED 
If the application is restarted after a suitable fixed interval, it shall help the 
application to adjust to its corresponding lighting conditions, and no other 
major change is required as well to the application. Ex-Let the application 
restart after 1-hour intervals, and hence it will adjust itself automatically 
with lighting conditions due to cloud factors, change in position due to the 
Sun, Moon, or any other light source. Each time the application restarts, 
it starts to record a new video file for that duration. Assume a bright light 
source appears in front of the lens of the camera. 
We can see in Figures 3.5–3.8 that as the light source is emitting light 
energy, the rays of light surrounding the source are also detected as an 
object by the object detection algorithm. Thus, in this way, the object 
appears to be detected by a detection window of larger size than the total 
area of the light-emitting region. 
FIGURE 3.5 Bright light source emitting light energy appears in dark lighting conditions.

FIGURE 3.8 Object appears in front of the camera along with a bright light source 
emitting light energy. 

 
 
 
50 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
In Figure 3.8, we can see that the application was able to detect 
another object (here, the hand). We can propose in the next section that if 
it is possible to detect light sources or other objects (trees, rocks, bushes, 
etc.) that are not desired for wildlife object detection, we may label such 
undesired objects as background and consider the rest detected objects as 
foreground (desired objects to be detected) as mentioned in the proposal 
section of this chapter. 
Similar observations are also noticed for light-emitting sources present 
in good lighting conditions in Figures 3.9–3.11. 
FIGURE 3.9 Light source emits light energy in well-lit lighting conditions. 
FIGURE 3.10 Object appears in front of the camera lens along with the bright light 
source emitting light energy.

Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
FIGURE 3.11 When the light source is not emitting light energy but is visible due to 
well-lit lighting conditions. 
Here also, in Figures 3.9–3.11, we find the light source emitting light 
energy as rays have been detected by a detection window of much larger 
size than the light emitting region of the light source. 
We may also apply a similar proposal to classify background and 
foreground objects like the previous cases, Figures 3.5–3.8, for cases of 
Figures 3.9 and 3.10 as well. 
We see here in this figure that the light source is detected by a far 
smaller object detected window than in the cases where it was emitting 
light energy. This is the case when the light source is an artificial light 
source. 
We are also not considering the visibility of an artificial light source 
when it’s not emitting light energy or is turned off in dark conditions, as it 
would be impossible to see it. 
Figures 3.5–3.11 are also simulations of the application with respect 
to visibility scenarios and object detection scenarios in day or night 
time. For Figures 3.5–3.10, the light source may be natural or artificial, 
but for Figure 3.11, it must always be an artificial source in a well-light 
surrounding environment. 
The light sources here may also be identified as classes and classified 
as background or foreground. Otherwise, if a light source is always present 
in front of the lens, then a graph may be plotted for the whole duration the 
light source is viewed as an object present in front of the lens. This will 
in turn make our purpose of application not fully utilized to reduce our 
editing or analysis efforts (Figures 3.12 and 3.13).

and ‘end timestamp’ to show the durations of objects detected. 
FIGURE 3.13 Motion graph showing durations of the object detected with their ‘start 
timestamp’ and ‘end timestamp’ as we hover over the graph. 
Hence, these are all the observations that we note from the application. 
Here, objects refer to ‘wildlife’ in objects detected. 
3.2.2 PROPOSALS 
The following is the list of proposals that have not been implemented 
in the source code the observations have been studied from but may be 
applied for future improvements of the application: 
• Objects may be identified with respect to well-defined classes based 
on available surroundings of the placement of the lens and hence 
be checked if it resembles any class from the already defined set of 

 
53 
Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
classes. After identification of such classes, they may be classified 
as background or foreground so that when an undesired object is 
detected, like a tree, stone, or light sources like the sun or moon or 
an artificial light source, they can be classified as the background 
so that the graph doesn’t start to plot with respect to the undesired 
objects. This will be helpful if a tree is always present in front of 
the lens and the object detection algorithm starts to identify it as 
the desired object and hence draw a graph for the whole duration it 
was present (here, always), thus leading our intention of using the 
application for our desired purpose not get satisfied. 
• Deep learning and machine learning techniques can be utilized 
effectively in identifying classes and hence making object detection 
smoother and more efficient. 
• Contextual information and temporal features: Incorporating back-
ground details could help to increase the qualities of being efficient 
and robust for the application. However, it is still a dilemma as 
to which moment (i.e., prior or later to object detection) and how 
these details could be integrated. The solution is yet not known for 
this, but it is assumed to possess a verifiable solution. There have 
been ideas for a few solutions, like the addition of the usage of 
spatiotemporal context [2], spatial structure amongst visual words 
[3], and semantic information focusing on plotting semantically 
associated characteristics to visual words [4], amongst others [5–9]. 
There can be advantages to Temporal features [10, 11] as a good 
number of approaches assess the detection of objects in a single 
frame [1]. 
• High resolution of apparatus is required for the best results. 
• To increase the efficiency of the analysis of the huge amount of 
data, we can use GPUs. 
• For cameras overhead (e.g., in drones or overhead cameras) during 
the time of dawn or dusk, we get shadows beside objects like in 
Figures 3.14 and 3.15. 
 
We get such shadows of objects (animals, trees, etc.) for certain 
times of the day, like dawn and dusk, when light appears at a 
certain angle, and we have overhead cameras.

FIGURE 3.15 The shadow of a bull (toy). 

 
 
 
55 
Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
If we use techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to 
identify the such pattern of objects, then we can easily identify objects 
accordingly and also classify them as what they are. This becomes very 
much useful for drone shots that are being used these days extensively for 
filming and editing. 
• For objects that are heavily camouflaged, it is very difficult to 
detect them. Ex-Snow leopards, chameleons, etc. 
 
 To detect them, we may use trace the edges of the surrounding envi-
ronment initially and set them fixed. Next, the comparison is made 
with the initially traced edges of the surrounding environment and 
the edges that are being traced with respect to time continuously. 
There may possibly be an intrusion by an object if a disruption in 
the continuity of the edges takes place. 
Example situation – let it be a snowy mountainous region inside 
a snow leopard habitat. Let the camera be set up beside a water 
body, with the lens facing the other side of the bank. Initially, 
the edges of the bank are traced and saved. Now as with each 
passing moment, the edges are traced, and compared with the 
initially traced edges, we find that no disturbance or intrusion 
has taken place. Until the snow leopard appears, which is highly 
camouflaged with the surroundings, and starts to drink with its 
tongue. As soon as the tongue breaks the continuity of the edge of 
the bank, the algorithm detects an intrusion and suspects that there 
is an object present at that particular position. The graph starts to 
be plotted accordingly for the duration the snow leopard drinks 
water and hence in this way highly camouflaged objects could 
also be detected. 
• A timer is maintained with a specific interval set, after which the 
application restarts to adjust to its surrounding lighting features, 
etc. Each time the application restarts, a new video recording file is 
created and starts to record until the next restart. 
• If all or majority of the pixels of the image with respect to time (i.e., 
video sequence) get affected within a very short duration of time, 
then we can make a case that the object is too close to the lens of 
the camera (Figure 3.16). 

 
 
 
56 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
FIGURE 3.16 Object too close to the lens of the camera. 
• Sometimes, we may also find object detection windows randomly 
detecting objects that do not exist. Such cases detect objects for a 
very short duration of time. We can specify a minimum duration 
of the object detected, after which the graph to be plotted should 
start. In this way, we can get rid of such random object-detected 
windows that pop up during the runtime of the application by 
setting a threshold time duration. 
3.3 DISCUSSIONS 
3.3.1 CURRENT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS 
1. Multiple-Class: There are many examples of the usage of 
programs where detecting multiple object classes is needed. The 
types of classes that the system can support and manage without 
accuracy loss and the rate of processing are essential factors in 
this case. In Refs. [12–17], there are works that have dealt with 
multi-class detection issues. The same form of representation for 
numerous object classes, and multi-class classifier development 
that is precisely designed to detect multiple classes have managed 
to deal with the efficiency issue. One of the rarely available works 

 
57 
Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
for multi-class object detection is discussed in Ref. [18]. Around 
1,00,000 object classes were taken into consideration for this. In 
this application, if the algorithm was developed to be able to detect 
more than one object class, then it would be much more advanta-
geous with respect to future use as the invention or creation of 
new objects, fashion changes, etc., are a frequent occurrence in the 
21st century, and hence our object detection systems will require 
to be updated continually to add new classes or updating already 
existing classes [1]. 
2. Multiple-View, Multiple-Pose, Multiple-Resolution: Amongst 
the approaches that are currently in usage, a majority of such detect 
a single object class with respect to a single view. Thus, they lack 
the ability to manage multiple views or significant posture changes. 
This includes an exception of deformable part-based models that 
are able to handle a few posture changes. Learning subclasses [19] 
or by taking into account postures/views as separate classes [16] 
are the two ways some works have ventured to detect objects. As 
a result, there have been significant improvements in the fields 
of efficiency and being robust. Furthermore, there also has been 
the development of multi-pose models [20] and multi-resolution 
models [21]. With the ability to detect multiple views, multiple 
poses, or multiple resolutions would make the application highly 
robust and dynamic to be used in real-time as in wildlife we may 
find animals in numerous poses and views in front of the lens of 
the camera [1]. 
3. Efficiency and Computational Power: One of the most important 
variables that must be considered is efficiency in any object-
detection system. When efficiency is an essential requirement the 
coarse-to-fine classifier is generally the first kind of classifier to 
be taken into account [10]. Methods like reducing the total amount 
of picture patches classification needs to be performed [22] and 
efficiently identifying many classes [16] have also been deployed. 
Real-time performance is not implied by efficiency, and works such 
as in Ref. [23] are robust, scalable, and efficient and not adequate 
for real-time problems. But, some approaches (for example, deep 
learning) can be run in real-time utilizing specialized hardware 
(e.g., GPU). GPU development has been progressing at a good pace 

 
 
58 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
during recent years, and more development is expected in this field 
in the upcoming years as well with much greater abilities embedded 
in them. GPUs are also an important part of gaming in these years, 
and a large number of people own GPUs these days [1]. 
4. Occlusions, Deformable Objects and Interlaced Object, and 
Background: Although relevant research has been [24] done 
there exists no compelling solution to deal with partial occlusions. 
Objects where objects and background pixels can be found not 
interlaced are known as “closed” objects. Detecting objects that 
are not “closed” is still a tough problem that exists. Examples of 
such problems are hand detection [25] and pedestrian detection 
[26]. More development on the deformable part-based model is 
still necessary [23] as it has been able to achieve success only to 
some extent in this type of problem. Provisions to handle occlu-
sions, deformable objects, and interlaced objects and background 
shall be highly useful for further development of the application 
as such situations may occur during use in real-life environ-
ments, especially with wildlife that is highly camouflaged in their 
surroundings [1] (Figures 3.17 and 3.18). 
FIGURE 3.17 Occlusions as cage bars. 

 
 
 
This may confuse object-detection algorithms to identify them 
as different objects or as a single object. Objects may also use 
their color as camouflage with surroundings for cases of interlaced 
objects and backgrounds. 
5. Contextual Information and Temporal Features: Incorporating 
background information (e.g., about the scene and the presence 
of other objects) could improve the efficiency and robustness of 
the application. But, the procedure of ‘when and in which way’ to 
do this, that is before or after the detection of objects takes place 
is still a problem that exists in the open world. Some solutions 
have been proposed, and those among many others [5–9] are the 
use of (i) spatiotemporal context [2]; (ii) spatial structure among 
visual words [3]; and (iii) semantic information attempting to 
map semantically relevant aspects to visual words [4]. Because 
most algorithms examine object detection in a single frame [1], 
temporal characteristics might be advantageous [10, 11].

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
This is another very important feature that shall be necessary for the 
usage of such applications in real-life scenarios, as cameras can then have 
more information regarding their surroundings. This will, in turn, help 
them identify objects that are to be considered background (undesired) or 
foreground (desired). Thus, making object detection in dynamic situations 
efficient and effective. 
3.3.2 SINGLE OBJECT DETECTION USED IN THE APPLICATION 
Single object detection: The focus of the application described in this 
manuscript is to identify single objects effectively as our graph will be 
plotted as soon as an object is detected by the object-detection algorithm. 
The duration in which the object appears is shown by the graph. And 
during video analysis or editing, we only work with those portions of the 
video in which the object appeared. Thus, if we have a lioness walking 
with her cubs or a herd of zebras in front of the lens, if the algorithm of 
the application can identify one object effectively amongst them, then we 
can work that duration of the clip for analysis or editing as its graph gets 
plotted accordingly with respect to the single object detected. This reduces 
the complexity of developing complex algorithms to identify multiple 
classes of objects, and we haven’t used such complex code for the purpose 
of working with video clips that are only required when an item emerges 
in front of the camera’s lens. 
3.3.3 FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS 
1. Open-World Learning and Active Vision: A vital problem is 
to gradually learn to be able to detect new classes or to gradu-
ally learn to be able to distinguish between subclasses after the 
“main class” has been learned. We would be able to create new 
classifiers from existing ones without much effort if this could be 
done in an unsupervised way. Thus, lowering the efforts required 
to learn new object classes. Creation or invention of new objects, 
fashion changes/styles, etc., are coming up constantly in society 
in this century, and hence our systems will also need to keep 
pace with them. There needs to be always updates, the addition 

 
61 
Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
of new classes, or updates of existing classes. These problems 
have been addressed with methods based on deep learning and 
transfer learning methods [27–29] in recent times. This open-
world learning is of particular importance in robot applications’ 
cases where active vision mechanisms can aid in the detection and 
learning [30, 31]. The “open-world learning and active vision” 
sector is expected to develop in the future as object detection, and 
computer vision is being incorporated into appliances of daily 
lives these days at a pace much greater than in the last decade [1]. 
2. Object-Part Relation: There still exists a dilemma during the 
detection process whether the object should be detected first or the 
parts of the object should be detected first. And, no clear answer 
exists. Perhaps, these two processes should be continued simulta-
neously while both give feedback to each other. How this can be 
achieved is yet an open problem and is expected to be related with 
how to use the context information. Also, an object’s part may be 
decomposed into subparts. An interaction amidst several hierar-
chies emerges, and it is still not clear about what should be done 
first in general. The dilemma of Object-Part relation also comes 
into the picture for the application here as if the object detection 
algorithm were to identify an animal according to their physical 
features like the horns of cow, buffalo, or deer. Also, if the object 
were heavily camouflaged in its surroundings with only one such 
physical feature visible clearly out of camouflage (here, horns) 
and hence the object detection algorithm searches for resemblance 
with such classes that it already has prior knowledge about [1]. 
3. Pixel-Level Detection (Segmentation) and Identification Back-
ground Objects: We could be interested in recognizing items that 
are often ignored as background. Rivers, fences, and mountains 
are examples of “background objects.” Most of the methodolo-
gies presented in this chapter do not address the identification of 
background objects. The image is first segmented, and then each 
segment of the image is labeled [32]. This is how similar problems 
have been solved in the past. To completely comprehend a scene 
and effectively detect all items inside it, we will need pixel-level 
object detection as well as a 3D representation of the scene. Hence, 

 
62 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
there exists a possibility that the object detection and image 
segmentation methods may require to be integrated together. The 
automatic comprehension of the world is still far to be achieved. 
And, to achieve this, active vision mechanisms may be required [9, 
33]. Objects being identified or classified as background objects 
can simplify the need to detect desired objects or the foreground. 
This makes the application familiar with its surrounding environ-
ment during its usage and also detects objects that are desired 
to be detected. This feature can become much helpful for the 
deployment of such applications or cameras with object-detecting 
abilities as the surrounding environment is changing rapidly in 
recent times, and humans are also creating new objects, fashion 
changes, etc. Embedding these features with the Object detection 
application will improve productivity, produce desired results, and 
also improve the robustness of the application with respect to the 
environment it has been positioned or placed or on [1]. 
4. Presence of Adversarial Patches: There may exist an adversarial 
patch that can be used to bypass the object detection algorithm 
toward invisibility [34]. Researchers at KU Leuven generated 
an adversarial printout patch that can fool an object detection 
algorithm YOLOv2 [35]. For this to work, the patch has to be 
held at a specific position and angle. Hence, if the adversarial 
patches are changed dynamically on a target object, then it can 
fool the AI much more effectively. It can only trick one particular 
algorithm. However, it may be possible to use this technique to 
produce clothing that works like an invisibility cloak for surveil-
lance cameras or other cameras with object detection ability. It can 
be possible in the future those adversarial patches may exist for 
object detection algorithms that bypass object detection algorithms 
towards invisibility. 
3.4 CONCLUSION 
Human-level efficiency is yet to be achieved in terms of the technology 
available for object detection. Quad-copters, drones, and service robots in the 
future, etc., are going to be deployed gradually. Previously mentioned gadgets

Object Detection from Video Sequence and Its Analysis for Application 
and appliances are examples of mobile robots and autonomous machines. 
The need for more object detection systems is being felt as time and tech­
nology progress. Several technologies present are a part of appliances used 
by consumers currently. Such examples can be mentioned as auto-focus in 
smartphones and assisted driving technologies. Immense progress has been 
achieved and observed in recent years owing to the technological advance­
ments and efforts of the scientific research community [1]. 
The current manuscript discusses how the single object detection 
method may be used to tackle problems in analysis and editing purposes 
for wildlife documentaries or wildlife filming, etc. The approach can 
hugely reduce the amount of effort required to go through clips recorded 
in a large time span of the day the camera records at a fixed position. It 
increases productivity and reduces the cost of analysis of long video clips 
manually by professionals for wildlife filming, editing, and analysis. The 
single object detection algorithm serves the purpose if the desired object 
is detected. We shall continue to integrate object detection algorithms in 
our lives as more progress is expected in the fields of object detection and 
computer vision in the times ahead.

ABSTRACT 
A porous media consists of a 3D intricate network of pores that are arranged 
either in a symmetric or non-symmetric pattern, allowing for the fluid to 
pass through the void spaces. The larger the pores size or the porosity of 
the medium, the higher the permeability of the fluid through the porous 
medium [8]. Porosity, in this case, is defined as the ratio of the volume of 
the void space to the total volume of the matrix, and permeability is defined 
as the measure of the porous media to allow the fluid to flow through 
the pores. As such, the transportation of fluid through a porous medium 
is of high interest in understanding the effects of material porosity and 
permeability in heat, mass, and moisture transport in real-life situations 
such as percolation of water to the underground water table, contaminant 
transport in aquifers, chromatography separations, etc., where the natural 
porous media govern a plethora of interacting and dynamic processes 
and as such a better understanding of pore scale transport phenomena 
has become necessary [3]. The numerical modeling of fluid transport

through a natural porous media using commercial software, COMSOL 
Multiphysics, to emulate these natural processes is used for assisting 
engineers and researchers in comprehending the ill effects of these natural 
processes, if any, and at the same time replicating these natural processes 
artificially in places where similar end effects are required. With a proper 
understanding of the fluid flow in these porous media, efficient systems 
can be designed keeping in mind the recent energy crisis and the need for 
sustainable development. 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
A porous medium, by definition, is any material that is composed of a 
dense matrix and a network of interconnected voids. The matrix of the 
porous material comprises the skeletal portion of the material. The pores 
of a porous medium are typically occupied by a fluid (liquid or gas). One 
or more fluids will flow through the material due to the interconnectedness 
of the voids or the pores [11]. The fluid can flow through the pores can 
be in a single phase or in a multiphase [9]. In sponges, the solid matrix, 
and the porous network (called pore space) are continuous in sponges 
resulting in the formation of interpenetrating phenomena. Fluid flow in a 
porous media is caused by the differential viscosity, gravitational forces, 
and capillary action through the pore spaces [10]. 
The distribution of pores in a normal porous medium is irregular in 
terms of form and scale. Sand, sandstone, shale, rye bread, wood, and the 
human lung are examples of porous media in nature [12]. Subsequently, 
the determination of flow through a porous media is of extreme importance 
for characterization purposes. In these cases, a flow sensor comes into 
play when determining the flow rate of any single-phase flow in a porous 
medium. A flow sensor is an electronic device that is used to measure or 
regulate the rate of flow of any liquid or gas in a flow channel. Flow sensors 
are usually used in conjunction with gauges to calibrate the measurements 
and for proper recording for future purposes. Flow sensors can be of two 
major types depending upon the use, viz., differential pressure flow sensor 
and mass flow sensor. However, the most common parameters control­
ling the type of flow sensor used are material type, pressure, and required 
accuracy. Differential flow sensors like venturi tubes, rotameters, and 
orifice plates are predominantly used due to their performance accuracy 
and versatility of applications, whereas the mass flow sensors are used 

 
 
 
Design of a Flow Detection Sensor for Single Phase Flow Through Porous Media 
69 
in automotive industries where they are used for measuring the air intake 
systems of an internal combustion engine. 
The divergence between the solver used for the numerical simulation 
of a flow through porous media and the real flow structure determines the 
way in which the flow through the porous media is modeled [1]. When the 
distance between the object and the observer is small, the flow through 
the medium is perceived to either consist of single or multiple channels or 
single or multiple closed cavities. For such types of flow, the conventional 
rules for flow dynamics and convective heat transfer is applicable; as such, 
the utilization of a flow sensor is necessary for determining the flow rate 
in a porous media to eliminate the utilization of expensive experimental 
setups for characterization purposes. 
The complexities of the path of the flow in a porous media rule out the 
traditional solutions where the conventional techniques of fluid flow and 
heat transfer are predominant. Volume aggregation and global measure­
ments (e.g., permeability, conductivity) are helpful in defining and simpli­
fying the flow in this maximum. Examples of filtration, geomechanics, soil 
mechanics, rock mechanics, petroleum engineering, geosciences (hydro­
geology, petroleum geology, geophysics), biology, biophysics, material 
science, and others all use the principle of porous media [5]. Fluid flow 
through porous media is a topic of widespread interest that has spawned 
its own area of research. In synonyms with the development of research 
in fluid flow in porous media, there is the simultaneous development of 
widespread application of sensors in porous media flow. 
The characterization of a porous medium is usually done on the basis 
of two main methods, viz., porosity and permeability, where the porosity 
of a porous structure is defined as the fraction of the total volume of the 
medium that is occupied by void space, where permeability is defined as 
the ability of a porous matrix to allow flow through it. These two major 
factors are taken into consideration when determining the design of the 
flow sensor for fluid flow in a porous media [6]. 
4.1.1 DARCY’S LAW 
This section discusses the modification of the momentum equation for a 
porous medium which is the analog of the Navier-Stokes equation [1] and 
[13]. In 1855, a French hydraulic engineer named Henri Darcy worked on 
a series of experiments to determine the flow rate of water through layers 

 
 
70 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
of sand and its relation to the loss of pressure head along the path of flow. 
However, Darcy’s law is applicable to low flows with low velocity and to 
flows without boundary shear flows [2]. 
For the studies, Darcy used a vertical column with a water inlet from 
one end and an outlet from the other. The setup had reservoirs to replenish 
and maintain the constant water levels and also the pressures at the inlet and 
outlet (denoted h1 and h2) (Figure 4.1). The experiments were performed 
using different sand packings and as well as sets of tests with the same 
packing but using different column heights. 
Darcy determined a tube’s discharge by calculating the amount of 
water that flows out the outlet over a set period of time (e.g., 1 minute). 
His studies were designed to look at the fundamental factors that influence 
groundwater flow. It employs a “Darcy channel,” a sediment-filled tube 
from which water will flow. Water flows from a raised tank into the Darcy 
tube’s inlet, into the sediment, and out the tube’s outlet. Darcy’s results 
quantified the relationships between volumetric groundwater flow rate, 
moving forces, and aquifer properties, laying the groundwork for modern 
hydrogeology. Darcy’s experiments revealed proportionalities between 
the flow of water, Q, through the laboratory “aquifer” and the properties of 
several experimental devices [14].

i. 
Q(Flow rate) is directly proportional to the difference in water 
levels between the inlet and outlet, h1 – h2 = Δh: Q ∝ Δh. 
ii. Q(Flow rate) is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the 
vertical column: Q ∝ A. 
iii. Q(Flow rate) is inversely proportional to the length of the column: 
Q ∝ 1/ΔL. 
Combining the above proportionalities leads to Darcy’s Law, which is 
given as: 
Q = KA(Δh/ΔL) 
where; A is the cross-sectional area; L is the length of the column; K is 
the proportionality constant which is denoted as hydraulic conductivity; 
(h1 – h2)/l is the hydraulic gradient. 
The permeability of any porous medium is determined by its porosity, 
grain size, and interconnection of the pores. As such, Darcy’s experiment 
is dependent upon the type of grain bed used. 
4.1.2 FLOW SENSORS/METERS 
Flows can be open channel type and closed channel type. When a flowing 
stream has a free, unrestrained surface, it is called an open channel flow, 
whereas a flow in a channel is one occurring in a closed system or a conduit 
and the flow is a pressure-driven one. Flow in the water supply of pipes 
is the most common example of a closed channel flow, while on the other 
hand, an open channel flow is one that is usually evident in sand beds, 
usually gravity-driven flow. 
4.1.2.1 DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE FLOW SENSOR 
The flow is measured in a differential pressure drop set up by calculating 
the drop in head caused by a barrier in the fluid flow path. This drop is 
evaluated using a signal which is a function of the square of the speed 
of the flow calculated using Bernoulli’s equation. The most widely used 
differential flow meters are discussed in subsections. 
4.1.2.1.1 Orifice Plates 
The difference in pressure between the upstream and downstream sides of 
a partially obstructed channel is used to calculate fluid flow with an orifice 

 
 
 
72 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
plate. The flow-obstructing plate forces the flowing fluid to contract by 
creating a carefully calculated barrier in the pipe. Orifice plates are simple, 
inexpensive, and may be made in almost any material for virtually any use. 
Figure 4.2 depicts the schematic of an orifice plate setup.

4.1.2.1.2 Venturi Tube 
The venturi-type flowmeter is applicable where low-pressure drops are 
needed as compared to orifice plates, due to the simplicity in design. 
The rate of flow is determined by a reduction in the cross-sectional flow 
area, thereby causing a pressure difference, as shown in Figure 4.3. After 
passing through the neck region of the tube, the fluid passes through a 
pressure recovery section where 80% of the head is developed.

4.1.2.1.3 Flow Nozzle 
In industrial applications, flow nozzles are often used as measurement 
elements for air and gas flow, as shown in Figure 4.4. 
FIGURE 4.4 Flow nozzle.

4.1.2.2 MASS FLOW SENSOR 
Mass meters directly measure the mass flow rate in a flow channel. The 
different types of mass flow meters are given in subsections. 
4.1.2.2.1 Thermal Flow Meter 
The thermal mass flowmeter does not rely on density, strain, or viscosity 
to work. Thermal meters use a heated sensing system that is separated 
from the fluid flow direction and emits heat from the sensing element to 
the flow stream. The conducted heat is exactly proportional to the mass 
flow rate, and the temperature differential is computed to mass flow. 
The accuracy of the thermal mass flow system is determined by the 
process’s calibrations as well as differences in the fluid’s temperature, 
pressure, flow rate, heat power, and viscosity.

4.1.2.2.2 Coriolis Flowmeter 
The Coriolis Mass Flowmeter measures the volume of mass flowing 
through the element using the Coriolis effect. The fluid to be analyzed is 
forced to vibrate in an angular harmonic oscillation through a U-shaped 
conduit. The tubes can deform due to Coriolis forces, adding an extra 
vibration dimension to the oscillation. This extra part triggers a phase 
change in certain areas of the tubes, which can be detected using sensors. 
4.2 NUMERICAL MODELING USING COMSOL 
Two different porosity configuration cases are being numerically modeled 
and analyzed so that a comparison can be made between the effect of pore 
size on porosity and permeability, viz., aligned and staggered grid, as 
shown in Figure 4.5 for both arrangements. This is being done to ascertain 
the effect of the pore size and its arrangement on the flow dynamics of the 
porous media. As such, this can be used for the design and manufacturing 
of metal foams and other additively manufactured components. 
FIGURE 4.5 Aligned tube bank (left); and staggered tube bank arrangement (right). 
4.2.1 GEOMETRY OF ALIGNED TUBE ARRANGEMENT 
Modeling of the aligned tube arrangement was made using COMSOL 
Multiphysics Geometry Modeler using two different dimensional configu­
rations for the aligned tube arrangements, mentioned below. Figures 4.6 
and 4.7 show the geometry created for aligned tube arrangement for both 
dimensional configurations.

4.2.2 MESHING OF THE GEOMETRY AND CASE SETUP 
The mesh of the geometry was created using COMSOL Multiphysics 
Default Mesher with an extra fine mesh size. This was done to capture 
the fluid flow properties at the edges of the tube where due to a change of 
geometry, there is eddy and micro-eddy generation. Figures 4.8 and 4.9 
show the mesh generated for both configurations for aligned tube banks.

For setting up the case, a laminar single-phase creeping flow was taken 
into consideration. Inlet pressure was taken to be 0.1 Pa at the inlet, and the 
pressure at the outlet was taken to be 0 Pa to generate a pressure gradient-
driven flow. A periodic flow condition was taken to be on the top, and 
bottom edges of the geometry, and the curved edges depicting the tubes 
in 2D were taken to be as a wall, and the path of the flow is considered to 
be in the x-direction with the inlet being at edge located at the origin. For 
simulating the case, a steady-state solver was employed. 
4.2.2.1 GEOMETRY OF STAGGERED TUBE ARRANGEMENT 
Modeling of the aligned tube arrangement was made using COMSOL 
Geometry Modeler using two different dimensions for the staggered tube 
arrangement, mentioned below. Figures 4.10 and 4.11 depict the model 
created for symmetric staggered tube arrangement.

4.2.2.2 MESH OF STAGGERED TUBE ARRANGEMENT AND CASE SETUP 
As in the case of aligned tube arrangement, the mesh of the staggered 
tube geometry was created using COMSOL Multiphysics Default Mesher 
with extra fine mesh size. This has been due to capturing the micro eddy 
generation at the places of change of path to the flow of the fluid, which 
enhances the mixing of the flow. Figures 4.12 and 4.13 show the mesh 
generated for both configurations of staggered tube bank arrangement. 
FIGURE 4.12 Mesh of staggered tube bank arrangement with first configuration.

FIGURE 4.13 Mesh of staggered tube bank arrangement with second configuration. 
A laminar single-phase creeping flow was considered when setting up 
the case. To produce a pressure gradient-induced flow, the inlet pressure 
was set to 0.1 Pa at the inlet, and the outlet pressure was set to 0 Pa at 
the outlet. As in the case of the aligned tube bank flow, the x-direction 
of flow is considered, with the inlet edge being the leftmost edge of the 
geometry. On the top and bottom sides of the geometry, a periodic flow 
condition was assumed, and the bent edges representing the channels in 
2D were assumed to be walls. A steady-state solver was used to simulate 
the scenario. 
4.2.3 RATE OF RISE FLOW METER FOR POROUS MEDIA FLOW 
MEASUREMENT 
The rate of rise flow meter is a manual flow sensing device that is used 
to evaluate the rate of rise of any flow in a porous media. The rate-of-rise 
(RoR) method determines flow by measuring the time rate of change of 
height of a fluid flow in a porous media. This method is more of a visual 
method of detecting the flow of a fluid through a porous media where 
it involves the specimen being dipped in the sample solution, and then 

 
 
80 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
calculating the rate of rise of the height of the solution in the sample visu­
ally with respect to time. This method is mostly applied in wick structures 
to determine the rate of wicking, where wicking is defined as the rate of 
movement of the fluid through the capillary action from the inside of a 
porous wick structure. Figure 4.14 shows a typical setup used for the rate 
of rise experiment to determine the permeability of a sample.

4.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.3.1 RESULTS OF ALIGNED TUBE BANK ARRANGEMENT 
Due to the complexity of the problem, the problem cannot be solved 
accurately by analytical means and be used for comparison. As such, 
the velocity and pressure contours are analyzed. Also, the velocity has 
been plotted to determine the maximum velocity during the flow. Figures 
4.15–4.17 depict the profiles for aligned tube bank arrangement with Lx = 
Ly = 4 mm, whereas, Figures 4.18–4.20 show the profiles for Lx = 8 mm, 
Ly = 2 mm for the same tube arrangement.

4.4 CONCLUSION 
The permeability of the aligned tube bank is greater than the staggered 
tube path because the path of the flow of the fluid in the aligned tube bank 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Design of a Flow Detection Sensor for Single Phase Flow Through Porous Media 
87 
is less tortuous, i.e., the fluid flow path in the aligned grid has less number 
of curves and flow path changes as compared to the staggered grid, where 
the fluid flow path has bends to the path of the flow. The staggered grid 
has flow separation at multiple points at the leading edge of the staggered 
arrangement of the cylinders; as such, the permeability reduces. Also, for 
Lx = Ly = 4 mm dimension of the aligned tube bank, as compared to Lx 
= 8 mm and Ly = 2 mm, from the velocity profiles, it is seen that for the 
symmetric dimension, the velocity is more tortuous as compared to the 
non-symmetric dimension due to the fact that the flow develops along the 
length in the x direction and as such the flow settles due to no change in 
flow path subsequently making the flow magnitude constant. Similarly, 
for the staggered tube arrangement for the symmetric arrangement, the 
change velocity magnitude is higher at the central zone as compared to the 
non-symmetric arrangement due to flow development and settling. 
The rate of rise of fluid or the capillary action in porous media is used 
in the thermal management system of high-power density semiconductor 
devices, such as microprocessors, power switching devices, and lasers. As 
such, these porous media, or wick structures, are being used as passive 
cooling devices as they have the ability to handle very high heat fluxes 
and offer effective thermal conductivities better than conventional cooling 
devices. However, the porous media design has to be characterized as per 
the heat removal requirement. Therefore the rate of the rising flow meter 
has been aptly characterized as per the requirement of the efficiency of 
heat removal of the porous media.

ABSTRACT 
Tumor is a dangerous disease that kills thousands of people every day in 
India. The key cause is abrupt organ mass development. Tumors are divided 
into two types: benign and malignant. The main issue is that everyone’s 
size and shape are different. In order to discover this at an early stage, 
perfect segmentation is critical. Since manual segmentation varies between 
observers, it is sometimes inconclusive. This work introduces a novel deep 
neural network-based methodology for segmenting brain tumors and their 
sub-regions from multimodal MRI images, as well as survival prediction 
using characteristics generated from segmented tumor sub-regions and 
clinical characteristics. This study defines a computer-aided diagnostic 
approach. This section defines a computer-aided diagnostic approach that 
uses a deep learning-based technique called TransResV-Net, which is a 
V-net extension, to segment tumor cells. The revised V-Net outperformed 
the current finest practice strategies. V-net is more successful than the 
traditional network for pixel-based segmentation, and it is one of the

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
simplest methods for segmenting tiny data sets. This methodology is used 
to partition usable data collecting. This model is applied to the usable 
BRATS 2015, Kaggle data set comprising 120 patients’ MRI images to 
apply the segmentation. Apart from this, various databases are available. 
But this BRATS 2015 is chosen for this experiment. This experiment is 
being conducted for 20 epochs, and the result is being compared with 
the supplied ground truth, and the segmented outcome is assessed using 
metrics such as intersection-over-union; the dice coefficient was reported 
as 0.72 and 0.87, respectively. As compared to well-known and benchmark 
approaches, the result demonstrated a significant difference. Researchers 
in the fields of bioinformatics and medicine will benefit greatly from the 
high-performing TransResV-Net. 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
One of the most sensitive and varied organs in the human body is the 
brain, composed of several cells that function in tandem. A brain tumor 
develops as these cells congregate in or near the brain due to unregulated 
cell division [1]. These unwanted cells have the potential to kill other 
healthy cells while also interfering with the brain’s natural functionality. 
Brain tumors are generally classified into: 
i. 
Low-Grade (Grade I or II) or Benign Tumors: These cancers are 
not very dangerous and cannot spread to other areas of the body, 
making them non-cancerous. They are developed in the brain and 
develop at a slow pace. 
ii. High-Grade (Grade III or IV) or Malignant Tumors: These cancers 
are more aggressive than benign tumors and develop quickly, 
making them cancerous. They can be central, which means they 
originate in the brain, or secondary, which means they originate 
elsewhere in the body and subsequently spread to the brain [2]. 
Brain tumor segmentation is a critical step in medical image processing. 
Early detection of brain tumors improves therapeutic options and raises 
patients’ chances of recovery. The manual segmentation of brain tumors 
from vast volumes of MRI data generated in clinical practice is a hard and 
time-consuming technique [3]. The most lethal sickness is a tumor, and if 
it is in the brain, it is considerably more lethal. A biopsy can be performed 

 
 
 
91 
Deep Neural Network-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation 
for brain tumors in difficult-to-reach locations or in highly vulnerable 
parts of the brain that might be harmed by a more invasive technique; 
your neurosurgeon will drill a small hole into your brain. The cavity is 
then pierced with a small needle. The needle is used to scrap tissue and 
is often guided by CT or MRI scanning [1]. The mortality rate in India is 
almost 1,300 people per day [4]. Screening is very necessary to survive 
this. The main stage is to make a CAD system. For a long time, healthcare 
clinicians and researchers have focused on MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging) for the diagnosis and further modeling of tumor progression 
during the process of treatment of brain tumors. This approach is favored 
mostly because of the images, which are of good resolution, which aid in 
collecting a large volume of knowledge about the subject. Support vector 
machines (SVM) and Neural Networks are two other methods that have 
gained a lot of traction in this area over the last decade. Figure 5.1 shows 
the various stages of a brain tumor [5], where WHO graded these three 
images as Grade II, III, and IV (from (a), (b), and (c)) [6]. 
FIGURE 5.1 (a) Grade II; (b) grade III; and (c) grade IV. 
For regression of brain tumors in MRIs, the following steps are [7]: 
1. Data Acquisition of Brain MRIs: According to the World Health 
Organization classification system for identifying brain tumors, 
there are more than 120 different forms of brain tumors, most of 
which differ in origin. 
2. Image Segmentation: It is the method of segregating the various 
types of MRIs. Normal brain components such as gray matter, 
white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the skull, were 
separated from the actual tumor. This is done to make the tumor 

 
92 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
study easier in the approaching phases. This is accomplished by 
the use of the Fuzzy-C means clustering algorithm, which divides 
the picture into five sections or clusters. 
3. Feature Extraction and Reduction: DWT (discrete wavelet trans-
form) principal component analysis is used for minimization and 
is utilized for feature selection. DWT can extract the most relevant 
characteristics at different directions and scales in a hierarchical 
manner; they provide localized time-frequency information about 
a signal by employing cascaded filter banks comprising both high 
and low-pass filters. The PCAs are then used to reduce the initially 
extracted features to lower-dimensional feature vectors. 
4. Regression Using DNN: This is done using the 7-fold cross-
validation process for creating and training the neural network of 
a few hidden structures [8]. 
However, great progress has recently been made in the application 
of deep learning in the diagnosis and analysis of brain cancers. This is 
owing to the ease with which complicated relationships may be expressed 
without the requirement for as many nodes as SVMs and KNNs need. 
TransResV-net, a deep learning-based network, is used in this case to 
separate the tumor region from the MRI image on the data set [9]. The 
key benefit of this neural network is that it is a pixel-based segmentation 
approach, and it performs well with tiny data sets. Many studies on tumor 
segmentation have been conducted. Zhao et al. used a combination of 
Conditional Random Fields and a fully convolutional network to segment 
tumor cells [10]. Zhou et al. proposed 3D U-net to segment tumor cells 
using a combination of dilated convolution network and deep supervision 
[11]. Tewari et al. used deep transfer learning to classify the tumor, where 
accuracy is 100% [5]. Pradeep et al. segment the tumor cells using deep 
learning-based wavelet analysis [12]. Several classical methods are also 
adopted for the segmentation process [13], but the deep learning-based 
technique is better than the classical one. 
Here deep neural network-based segmentation model is discussed based 
on a modification of V-net. The work is organized in such a way, at first, 
there is an “introduction,” and then the “Methodology” is described. Then 
the “Data set” section is given. “Result analysis” is described, followed by 
“Experimental Setup,” then “Conclusion” is there.

Deep Neural Network-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation 
5.2 METHODOLOGY 
Brain segmentation may be divided into three categories based on the 
amount of user engagement required: 
1. Methods for Manual Segmentation: Manual segmentation is a 
time-consuming operation that is heavily reliant on the radiolo-
gist’s expertise. This means that, in addition to the anatomical and 
physiological knowledge gained via preparation and experience, 
the radiologist must make use of the multi-modality information 
provided by MRIs. The radiologist examines numerous slices of 
the photos slice by slice, then diagnoses and sketches the tumor 
regions carefully and methodically. However, the outcomes can 
differ greatly from one another [14]. 
2. Semi-Automatic Segmentation: Human intervention is primarily 
needed for three purposes in the semi-automatic method: initial-
ization, intervention, and assessment. During the initialization 
phase, an estimated region of possibility where the tumor may be 
situated is supplied for the automated algorithm to process, and 
pre-processing technique settings can be changed. By acquiring 
input and changing answers, the automated algorithms may then 
be adjusted to create the desired result. Furthermore, the customer 
will assess the findings and redo the whole procedure if they are 
not acceptable [15]. 
3. Fully Automatic Segmentation: Human intervention is not needed 
in fully automatic segmentation. In this approach, a mixture of AI 
and exact knowledge is being used to identify the separation issue. 
Automatic segregation is divided into two types: discriminative 
and generative. Discriminative approaches, in most cases, rely on 
supervised learning methods, which necessitate large data sets with 
a valid ground set. They try to figure out what the link is between 
the input picture and the ground reality. They are mostly determined 
by the features chosen and the extraction of features [16]. 
However, generative approaches produce likely probable maps by 
using previous information, such as the spatial scale of healthy tissues 
and the site of the tumor. Having said that, it is also worth noting that 
automated segmentation is difficult in the case of gliomas (a type of brain 

 
94 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
tumor). This is due to the uneven and unclear boundaries of the tumor, 
which pose a huge difficulty, especially against the traditional edge-based 
methods. Furthermore, the tumor’s form, size, and placement in the tumor-
bearing brain might vary from person to person [17]. 
Deep learning, also known as deep neural networks, is an AI-based 
function and a branch of machine learning that replicates the workings of 
the human brain in identifying expression, making decisions, and manipu-
lating data, i.e., the capacity to learn from both unstructured and unlabeled 
data by constructing a feature hierarchy. 
It has features such as image de-noising, pixel-based segmentation, 
regression, and registration that have piqued the interest of researchers all 
over the world. Deep Neural Network is a Deep Learning architecture that 
is frequently used for categorization all around the world. A neural network 
is a basic feed-forward route network in which data goes from the input 
layer to the output layer through numerous hidden layers. The structure of 
a conventional neural network is depicted in the diagram above. 
The bulk of diagnostic evidence in clinical practice, such as MRI, 
is composed of three-dimensional pictures. While most image analysis 
approaches can only process 2D images, completely convolutional neural 
network (CNN) based image segmentation of 3D volumetric data is 
cutting-edge [18]. 
V-Net architecture is identical to U-Net architecture with a few excep-
tions. It is divided into the compression path, the expansion path, the 
expansion path (left part), and the horizontal connections. Let us discuss 
the following two parts a bit more elaborately: 
• Left: 
 
It is divided into phases that operate at different resolutions. 
Each step on the left is made up of one to three convolutional 
layers. 
 
At each level, the input is processed by the convolutional 
layers, and the residual function is learned to be added to the 
last layer of that stage as an output. 
 
A voxel is the representation of the value on a regular grid in 
3D space. Volumetric kernels of 5*5*5 are used by the convo-
lutions performed at each stage. 
 
The number of feature channels is doubled at each level of the 
compression path, the resolution is reduced, and the size of the

Deep Neural Network-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation 
resultant feature maps is half as a consequence, with a goal 
similar to that of pooling layers. 
 
Down-sampling assists in increasing the receptive field. 
• Right: 
 
To collect the required information, this section extracts the 
features and boosts the spatial support of the lower-resolution 
feature maps. 
 
A de-convolutional operation is used at each level to enhance 
the size of the inputs, which are then followed by one to three 
convolutional layers. 
 
The residual function, like the left part, is taught in the right 
part as well. 
 
The final convolution layer produces two output feature maps, 
each of which is the same size as the input volume. 
 
These two maps are the probable, possible segmentation of the 
front and back regions. 
• Horizontal Paths: 
 
Location information is lost in the left path, like U-net. 
 
As a result, characteristics obtained from the left path’s early 
phases are passed on to the right path via horizontal connections. 
 
This helps in providing location information to the right part 
and consequently getting a better-quality of the final image. 
 
And these connections do help in improving the convergence 
time of the model. 
The primary V-Net model is split into two parts: encoder (feature 
extraction) and decoder (create the map to partition the job depending on 
the features) [19]. 
There is one similarity of this model with the conventional neural network, 
i.e., the encoder part is the same as a convolutional network. The input image 
passes through some steps, like two 3 x 3 convolution layers having the acti-
vation done by ReLU, and then from the feature map, the maximum pooling 
is done. Later on, the number of feature channels is increased by double its 
previous, and spatial measures are decreased by half [20]. 
In the case of the decoder part, the feature map calculation is the same 
as the encoder with two 3 x 3 convolution layers having the activation

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
again the ReLU. The feature stream quantity and spatial are repeated in the 
decoder section to keep the picture the same size as the input. 
In this way, the size is the same so that the result can easily be compared 
with the ground truth [9]. The structure is the extension of V net [21]. 
To concentrate on tumor cell segmentation using biomedical image 
processing, some modification is required on classical V-Net models, 
and the name is TransResV-Net. The proposed model is demonstrated 
here, with all possible definitions. Figure 5.2 is the schematic diagram of 
TransResV-Net.

5.3 DATASET 
At the moment, precise interpretation of the effects of different images 
from brain tumor segmentation techniques is a daunting challenge. 
However, the BRATS benchmark has become a commonly recognized 
benchmark for automated brain tumor segmentation. This enables remote 
comparison of various glioma segmentation approaches using standard 
datasets. 
The suggested technique divides the input magnetic resonance image 
(MRI) of the tumor into many steps and finally feeds the 2nd pixel of all 
steps into the neural network. The DNN then marks these middle pixels 
and performs segmentation. 
BRATS 2012 (2013, 2014, 2015, and ISLES 2015 and 2017 are among 
the eight large-scale benchmark datasets used. 
The BRATS 2015 image data set contains MR images, which are taken 
from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) [2]. The images are in .csv format. 
And there are original images as well as masks of the corresponding 
images. The total number of patients is 120; among them, 10 patients’ 
data need to be discarded because of the non-availability of proper cluster 
information. The sample images are given in Figure 5.3. There are four 
photos here, each having its own ground truth. Firth two images have a 
tumor, but the last two images do not have a tumor. 
FIGURE 5.3 Data set: Upper images have the tumor cell with ground truth and lower 
images have no tumor cell with ground truth.

5.4 DICE COEFFICIENT 
For three primary sections of the tumor, namely the entire tumor, core 
tumor, and active tumor, the findings are given via the online evaluation 
tool in the form of Dice Score, Sensitivity, and Specificity. The total tumor 
illustrates all of the tumor’s components, the core tumor represents every­
thing in the tumor, excluding edema, and the active tumor exhibits only 
the active cells [22]. 
The dice coefficient can be defined as twice the overlapped area by 
the total pixel number for both two images (image and ground truth). The 
equation is given as in Eqn. (5.1) and Figure 5.4. 
D = 2d/b 
(5.1) 
where; D is the Dice coefficient; d is the overlapped area of both images; 
b is the total pixel number of both images. 
FIGURE 5.4 Dice coefficient. 
5.5 INTERSECTION-OVER-UNION (IOU) 
The overlapping region between the segmented output and the desig­
nated ground truth separated by the union of the two may be shown as 
intersection-over-union (IOU). In Eqn. (5.2) and Figure 5.5, the equation 
is as follows. The result ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no overlap 
and 1 indicating complete overlap [23–29]. 
X = z/v 
(5.2) 
where; X is the IoU; z is the overlapped area of both images; v is the union 
of both images.

FIGURE 5.5 IoU. 
The Dice coefficient is indeed very identical to the IoU factor. They are 
highly associated, which means that if one thinks model X is better than 
model Y at image segmentation, the other would agree. 
They, such as the IoU, have a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 indicating the 
largest resemblance between expected and true. 
Figure 5.6 shows the training loss and validation loss curves which 
should be decreased exponentially corresponding to the epoch while 
increasing. 
FIGURE 5.6 Epoch vs. training loss and epoch vs. validation loss. 
It is very clear from the graph that the error decreases as the number 
of epochs increases. The errors should be minimized, and it happens. 
And Figure 5.7 shows the pictorial result of two input images and their 
corresponding ground truth. The segmented output and the ground truth 
are being compared, and the result is noted with respect to IoU and Dice 
efficiency. The value of IoU is 0.72. The result is given in Tables 5.1 and 
5.2 with a comparison with the well-known methods.

From Figure 5.7, it is obvious that the technique is really high. It is 
also observed that when there is tumor exists, then only this method shows 
with appropriate size (Figure 5.7, first row), whereas in the second row, 
there is no such tumor in that image, and the method also shows that.

Deep Neural Network-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation 
This makes the framework most valuable to segment almost all types 
of brain tumors. It is also clear from Tables 5.1 and 5.2 that this method 
shows the best possible result. 
5.6 CONCLUSION 
Deep learning is used in this case. TransResV-Net is used to separate 
tumor cells from MR images of the brain. A total of 120 patient cases were 
used; among them, 110 cases were taken because of the non-availability of 
proper cluster information. It is very clear from Figure 5.6 that the training 
loss and validation loss are decreasing with respect to epochs. The main 
advantage is that it is pixel-based segmentation, and for small data sets, 
this method is the best.

ABSTRACT 
In this chapter, a smart mirror-based home automation system is designed 
where voice commands (Google Assistance) in association with sensors 
are utilized for controlled regulatory measures. In this system, one 
channel is dedicated for motion sensing switching of the equipment and 
another dedicated for the light intensity-based switching of the equipment 
connected to the channel. In addition to turn-on and turn-off the lights 
as per voice request, it can also search the web for voice query and read 
out the results about the weather when asked for. It also smartly helps 
to reduce the energy consumption by switching off the device when not

needed. This system can be operated through Android and IOS-based 
mobiles, tablets, and even through computers or any purchased Google 
home devices and self-created microcontroller-based docks that are asso­
ciated with the owner’s Google account and have the permission to trigger 
byte information to the authenticated server. 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
Voice-operated switching control systems are the smarter version of the 
remote-controlled switching system, and can safely be applied inside a 
house, or a smaller unit, i.e., a room. In the last few years, demand of 
the smarter home is progressed [1, 2], and precisely for elderly people 
[3], speech recognition technology embedded with operation of electrical 
appliances become one key area of research. For trustworthy speech recog­
nition process, extensive uses of DSP (digital signal processor) proces­
sors are mentioned by various workers [1, 4], but the cost of the system 
also increases, which makes it unaffordable to many of the consumers. 
However, enhancement of comfort level is another closely interrelated 
non-measurable parameter, which demands augmentation of the system 
with mobile devices. This will help to make a composite system which is 
easy to operate with lower manufacturing cost, and moreover, the control 
terminal becomes portable [5]. 
Recently, power line system at infrared (IR) wavelength [6] is proposed 
to design a home automation system, whereas simple Short Message 
Service technology is proposed by another group [7] for the same purpose. 
Similar work was earlier carried out by Jawarkar et al. [8] using appropriate 
programmed chip to sustain AT command. Voice recognition in this system 
plays a major role as per a few published articles [9–10]. However, the 
cost function and system portability for common user becomes a concern, 
which needs to be optimized, as well as to help elderly people, where too 
much system complexity ultimately leads to failure for day-to-day use. 
Here comes the novelty of the present proposal. 
This proposal deals with an inexpensive system, where it uses Google 
Assistant (provided by Google to all their OS, and if necessary, it can 
be downloaded to other smartphone makers too like IOS by Apple), the 
IFTTT server and application, The Blynk application, and Google Cloud 
Console. In the hardware part, The NodeMCU 8266 micro-controller acts

Voice Command-Based Real-Time Automated Home Security System 
as the major communicator as it receives and sends data to the designed 
application and server, along with a relay board of 4/8 channel, who’s 
regulatory voltage is 5 volts and has the capability for handling 10 Amp 
current through it. Natural English language is used to give commands to 
Google Assistance and receive data on the Blynk app. In the next section, 
the total process flow diagram is briefly explained and subsequent section 
explains the obtained result followed by a conclusion. 
6.2 BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM 
Home automation system refers as smart home or intelligent home. Here 
we connect all units of components or part of home appliances through 
the art of science and technology. It is a system which tuning all kinds 
of features of home such as in environment [11]. It is one kind of system 
where it receives various kinds of input parameters and after assessing 
them gives output in terms of signals. Basically, it gathers all units within 
the internal environment and isolated these from the external environ­
ment. In highly tropical country the external environment parameters 
rapidly changes which can affect our home’s internal environment and 
it’s affected all the parts of home’s appliances. Each and every appliances 
follow such instructions and is programmable in such a way where the 
changes of environmental parameters from external to internal affects 
their performances and reduce their lifetime execution period. Most of 
the home appliances such as refrigerator, air-conditioner, inverter, electric 
fans, smart television, evaporative cooler, washing machine, micro-oven, 
home theater systems, etc. In some cases, beyond the boundaries, accident 
protection and road safety systems [12] are also required to facilitate 
modern day needs. Most of them consider as embedded systems where 
then appliances running through the subroutines programmable within it. 
Here these subroutines are working on the basis of internal environmental 
variables or parameters. The indoor or home internal environmental 
parameters are air quality such as humidity, carbon dioxide and oxygen 
balance, sound quality, lighting comfort, odor, microorganisms, vibra­
tions, thermal comfort, ergonomics, electromagnetic radiation, etc. These 
parameters are not the same inside and outside of a home in a tropical 
country where topographical features are changing rapidly throughout 
season-wise. Home is such type of combination of open and closed system 

 
108 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
where the internal and external parameters change rapidly. Home auto­
mation system is such kind of system which regulate or tuning internal 
parameters. These internal parameters are isolated from the external one 
and create an equilibrium stage between these two. Because most of the 
home appliances deteriorate their performance due to imbalance situations 
of internal and external parameters of the home. Home automation system 
is a kind of system which tunes the internal parameters of the home. It can 
tune input parameters, process parameters as well as output parameters 
also. 
Here all parameters measure through the exchange of information 
in terms of signals. Signal is one of the forms of electromagnetic radia­
tion which transfers from one system to another system. We know that 
three types of scattering of radiation are there: photoelectric, crompton, 
and coherent. To analyze this radiation, we need a device which absorbs 
this kind of radiation and gives a measurement of the level of radiation. 
Normally radiation represents a phenomenon about the environmental 
change happen for the incidents which changes through the parameters. 
These kinds of changes happen through the internal and external param­
eters of the home or a system. Based on these changes, a system defined 
as a closed or open system. Normally within the earth there is no existence 
of open system because every system surrounded by environment. So, by 
nature home is known as one kind of close system where internal and 
external parameters are connected with each other. As millions of radiation 
n form of scattering happen between the internal and external parameters 
of the home. So, to measure it we need a device which detect or measure 
these kinds of phenomenon or change of parameters of environment. We 
can use various kinds of sensors in home automation system because 
the sensor is one of the most efficient single points of contact for these 
parameters. Sensor is one kind of device where it detects the changes of 
measurement of parameters. Basically, each sensor works for a particular 
parameter. In-home automation system we use different kinds of sensors 
where each sensor performing different activities. Here below we mention 
some of the basic sensors which are used for a home automation system. 
We use heartbeat sensor, transmissive type IR sensor, reflective type IR 
sensor, rain sensor, touch sensor, temperature sensor, color sensor, alcohol 
sensor, PIR (passive infrared) sensor, gas sensor, smoke sensor, humidity 
sensor, water flow sensor, IR receiver, LDR (light dependent resistors) 
light sensor, photo translator light sensor, thermistor temperature sensor,

gyroscope motion sensor, ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture sensor, prox-
imity sensor, etc. 
Here we give a short view for the above sensors regarding their 
functionalities: 
1. Heartbeat Sensor: It is a plug-&-play device to measure the heart 
beat rate and pulse. 
2. Transmissive Type IR (Infrared) Sensor: It is one kind of optical 
transmit and receive device which acts as an interrupter used to 
locate movement of object. 
3. Reflective Type IR (Infrared) Sensor: It is another kind of 
motion detector sensor which detects signals coming from animal 
body. 
4. Rain Sensor: It is a device which changes its modes through the 
rainfall, which alerts to close the windows and doors. 
5. Touch Sensor: It is used to detect and store the record of touch 
coming from a living body. 
6. Temperature Sensor LM35: It is a calibrated circuitry device 
which measures temperature and giving an analog voltage output. 
7. Color Sensor: It is work upon photoelectric effect where it emits a 
light towards the object and receives the reflective one. By which 
it can detect the color of an object. 
8. Alcohol Sensor: It is a mosquito gas sensor and known as MQ3 
which detects the presence of ethanol in the environment. It is a 
chemi-resistor which detects any kind of gas leakage due to reac-
tion of metal oxide semiconductor with the gas molecules. 
9. PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensor: It is used as a security alarm or 
automatic light emission purpose for the detection of objects. It 
always emits IR signals and can measure that radiated IR signals 
from the object surface. 
10. Gas Sensor: It’s working principle just similar to alcohol sensor 
but it can detect any gas and emits a sound due to the presence of 
gas in environment [13] through voltage breakdown method.

11. Smoke Sensor: It can detect the presence of smoke in the environ-
ment by photoelectric or ionization method. Basically, it works as 
a fire alarm control purpose. 
12. Humidity Sensor: It is a calibrated device BME280 which is 
known as a hygrometer to measure the amount of moisture present 
in the environment. 
13. Water Flow Sensor: It contains a valve and a rotor which rotates 
when water flow through the valve and the sensor measures the 
number of rotations which proportion to amount of water flow and 
its speed. It is used in drainage system or washing machine or 
home water reservoir system. 
14. Water Level Sensor: It contains a series of variable resistors 
which measure the resistance which is calibrated with the level of 
water. Here we use copper resistors which indicate the signal to the 
LED power. We can use this in water reservoir system. 
15. IR Receiver: It is classified as active and passive IR sensor. It is a 
photodiode which detects an IR signal emitted from a transmitter. 
It is used to detect and analyze gas, water, flame, moisture, etc. 
16. LDR (Light Dependent Resistors) Sensor: It contains a series

6.3 ADVANTAGE OF HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM 
Home is an example of the smallest unit of close system which is a 
collection of several integrated embedded systems. In today’s world with 

 
113 
Voice Command-Based Real-Time Automated Home Security System 
modern trends of advanced technologies like IoT has a big impact on home 
automation system. All the home appliances are connected with each other 
through a set of sensors where they are passing various kinds of parameters 
with a lot of information such as device id, device name, device’s time, 
device’s set of configurations, device’s status, etc. Nowadays, we know 
that non-renewable energies are too much precious, so we use home auto­
mation systems to utilize the energy and save our world. In case of home 
automation system, we consume lots of energy for controlling light, fan, 
air-conditioner, refrigerator, air-cooler, geyser, Microwave oven, Cooking 
Gas, Washing Machine, Floor Cleaner or Vacuum Cleaner, Dish Washer, 
Coffee Maker, Blender, Mixer, Toaster, Television, and many more where 
we utilize lots of electricity or sources of non-renewable energy like coal 
petroleum assets. To avoid the wastage of these kinds of resources we either 
move to solar cell technology or smart home automation system. There is 
various problematic phase for solar cell installation because variations of 
weather in tropical country. So, we move towards smart home system or 
home automation system. 
It is used to save energy because we can control all kinds of switches 
very easily through one press mode. The fans, lights, and other appliances 
on-off activities happen very efficiently. It is very much easy to operate 
for old age people, as they can manage all devices from a single edge 
of point. There is no necessary to move throughout the floor or whole 
passage to control all home appliances. If they import some new high-end 
technological device then it is operated through the same process. As all 
the devices are connected through the internet so all devices are updated 
automatically without intervention of human operation. 
For home we always prefer the security aspects and it is more needed 
for old people. In home automation system security patches are very 
crucial and well maintain due to the impact of cloud computing. The 
federated architecture of cloud computing enhances security prospect in 
smart home automation system. After COVID-19 pandemic situation, the 
number of cases regarding house-theft issues increases due to the poor 
financial conditions of ordinary people. To secure our home, we need 
to use such an authentic system with our front door of house which is 
based on either face recognition based or human monitoring system that 
can monitor every locking system from inside of the home. This kind of 
security management system is very much essential for those old aged 
people who are staying or spending a lot of time alone in the house. Smart 

 
 
114 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
home automation system when connects image recognition it creates a 
face authentic security system which uses at front door. As per the proper 
recognition of face of family members, the door lights automatically on or 
off. Through proximity sensor if any unknown person moves in front of 
front door, then light on at once and recognizes face. If it is known, then 
either open automatically or gives notifications to the inside with the name. 
So, there is a knowledge base (KB) which stores the image of each face 
of members with their name of all family members and relatives. There is 
another procedure may be introduced where the proximity sensor sense 
and opens camera then take a snap of that incoming person and shows 
in a monitor which is inside of the home and waiting for notifications or 
commands of the house member whether the locks open or not. In this 
scenario we can manage the security of home automation system. Not only 
that we can manage a wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) concept by which we can 
share the device’s password among the members of the house. Using this 
password, they can lock or unlock the front door, because security factor 
is one of the most important issues for home automation system. This kind 
of security factor is also working and save the house from the neighbors, 
thief, etc., through one fingertip when there is no member in the house due 
to spending of some vacation period. 
For using floor management system, it is one of the most important 
pieces of equipment under this home automation system where not neces­
sary to move the whole floor area physically to clean the entire house. It 
does automatically by the voice commands. So, it is not required whether 
the members of the house within the house or not to manage the working 
procedure of smart automatic floor cleaner. This is one of the examples 
by which we can save our effort and time using smart home automation 
system. 
There is a concept of smart mirror as one of the components of smart 
home automation system where the mirror acts as a computer monitor or 
surveillance camera as per the voice commands. It can record all the inci­
dents throughout the day which were happened in front of this and recorded 
everything. So, parents who are busy in day time due to office can monitor 
the house servant and how they can manage and gives services to their 
children in absence of them in house. Here this kind of smart mirror also 
acts as a house manager. It can show the status of incoming parcel which 
ordered through online, location of cabs, important news highlights, status 

 
115 
Voice Command-Based Real-Time Automated Home Security System 
of all house appliances, on its screen. It also finds the mobile which is in 
silent mode through the voice commands by enabling its default ringtone. 
In smart home automation system, light management is one of the 
important factors for which people use it too much. There are no require­
ments of physically movement for switch on or off of the lights even with 
the help of object detection the light of staircases, corridor, balcony, and 
dining room automatically can manage which saves the lifetime of LED 
lights. 
It maintains equilibrium of Oxygen and Carbon-dioxide within the 
home and gives a healthy hygiene environment. It calculates heartbeat 
of house members automatically, count of footsteps, oxygen capacity of 
rooms as well as ratios of Oxygen and Carbon-dioxide for each room. It 
checks the ratio each and every time and when it crosses the threshold 
value the windows automatically opens or exhaust fan automatically turns 
on. Not only windows and doors connect with it, the chairs, tables, bed 
can also connect with it. When the house members get relaxed and spend 
leisure time by sitting on chair or by lying on bed or eating foods on table 
at that time the sensors which are connect with this furniture can fetch the 
pulse rate and gives the status of your body through voice response by 
measuring the heart related health parameters just like a smartwatch. 
So, this smart home automation system provides six sigma factors: 
control, savings, security, convenient, healthy, and comfort. 
6.4 PROCESS FLOW

6.6 CONCLUSION 
The aim of this chapter is to propose a cost-effective voice controlled (Google 
Assistant) home automation controlling general appliances found in one’s 
home with intelligence that can be integrated within their existing circuit. The 
approach discussed in the chapter is already implemented, and hence may 
be termed as successful so far. This system is highly reliable and efficient 
for aged people and differently able person on a wheelchair who cannot 
reach the switch for the switching ON/OFF the device and are dependent on 
others. It is also applicable on the areas where user need appliance to work 
without reaching the switchboard and for saving energy. This system can be 
implemented within the existing switchboard by using a two-way switch.

ABSTRACT 
This chapter demonstrates the numerous applications of intelligent agri­
culture, the advantages of IoT and UAV usage in agriculture, the variety 
of communication channels, and the connectivity issues and UAV and 
IoT restrictions in remote areas. The limitations of connection in terms 
of communication and transmission technologies were discussed in the 
chapter. Moreover, the chapter uses a system model to show how IOT and 
UAV are used to smart agriculture. 
7.1 BACKGROUND 
The population’s reliance on the agriculture industry has grown dramati­
cally. With the advent of technology, this epoch signifies a shift from 
traditional to the most imaginative techniques. Whatever people think 
about agricultural development, today’s agriculture business is more 
precise, data-driven, and smarter than ever before. Almost every busi­
ness, including “smart agriculture,” has been transformed by the fast 
advancement of IoT-based technologies, which has shifted the sector from 
statistical to quantitative techniques. These fundamental alterations shock 
conventional agricultural systems and provide new chances for a variety of 

 
 
 
124 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
issues. Researchers, research institutions, academics, and the majority of 
nations throughout the world are driven to collaborate in order to examine 
the boundaries of this issue of masculinity development. The technology 
sector competes in order to provide better solutions. IoT, cloud control, 
big data analytics (BDA), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), among 
other technologies, can give ample chance for situations to be forecasted, 
processed, and reviewed, and real-time activity to be restored. New fields 
in the field include the perception of heterogeneity and device interoper­
ability using flexible, ascending, and powerful method models. 
IoT may be applied in all aspects of life, including intelligent cities, 
intelligent homes, intelligent retail, and many more. The use of IoT in agri­
cultural agriculture is critical, given the world population’s ability to supply 
at much faster rates by 2050 to satisfy the highest peak of 9.6 billion. As 
a result, modern technologies, particularly IoT, are being used. IoT opens 
up the possibility of labor-free agriculture. It may also be used to support 
livestock, greenhouse farming, farm management, and other small-scale 
agricultural activities, in addition to large-scale agricultural operations. 
The most significant equipment used in IoT is sensors. Sensors are devices 
that collect vital data in order to perform the desired analysis. Sensors 
are commonly used in agriculture to collect data and determine levels of 
NPKs, pathogens, and humidity in soils. The internet of things (IoT) is 
being researched and explored for its potential applications in agriculture. 
Precision agriculture refers to smart agriculture that uses correct data to 
reach a conclusion. The sensors demonstrate a wide range of applications, 
issues, benefits, and drawbacks to help with IoT and farming. 
As a result of the rapid technological advancement and decline in 
human capability, technology is becoming engaged in every step of our 
lives. Agriculture and irrigation are two areas where man’s potential may 
be realized. Various sensors and electronic devices are employed in the 
industry to commercialize while keeping prices low in a few areas. To 
save money and improve agricultural workers’ abilities, UAVs (unmanned 
aerial vehicles) can be used for reconnaissance, pesticide, and insecticide 
application, and bioprocessing fault detection. In this application, both 
single-mode and multi-mode UAV systems can be used. A single UAV 
system’s skill can be surpassed by the proper collaboration and synchroni­
zation of a network of UAV clusters connected to terrestrial infrastructures, 
GCS, or satellites. As a result, the mobility model and requirements are the 
most effective routing protocol for each individual agricultural application.

Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
7.2 INTRODUCTION 
The Latin term ‘Ager’ means ‘Land,’ ‘Culture’ means ‘Cultivation,’ and 
‘Agricultura’ means ‘Agriculture.’This is one of the benchmarks for human 
growth. Ample revolutions were prepared throughout human history in 
order to make development on agricultural output with less properties and 
work. However, in all these ages, the high population level never allowed 
demand and supply to equal. Over 60% of the population is dependent on 
farming and around 12% of the total land area is subject to agricultural 
produce in accordance with the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) [1]. In 2050, the world’s population is anticipated to 
reach 9.8 billion, an improvement of around 25% in relation to the existing 
state of affairs [2], according to the projection scenario. The population 
growth among the emerging nations is almost entirely projected [3]. On 
the other hand, the trend of urban expansion is expected, with nearly 70% 
of global population projections expected to continue at an accelerated 
pace through 2050 [4]. In India, the farming region occupies over 50% of 
the population, and the livelihood of around 61.5% of the Indian people 
depends mostly on agriculture [5, 6]. 
Over the last several decades, however, agricultural production is 
undergoing a fourth revolution through using ICT in conventional agri­
culture [7]. The majority of technologies are advantageous and may boost 
innovation in agriculture systems, such as BDA, and machine learning 
(ML), remote sensing, the IoT internet, UAVs [8, 9]. A wide range of 
agricultural constraints can be seen with smart farming in order to increase 
crop yields, ease costs and increase process inputs such as environmental 
conditions, soil development status, irrigation water, pesticides, and fertil­
izer products, the management of weeds, and the environment of green­
house production [10]. Intelligent farming is a green technology practice 
since it reduces traditional agriculture’s environmental footprint [9]. 
Precision agriculture may also reduce liquidation issues and productivity 
as well as impacts of climate change in the absence of any insignificant 
use of fertilizer and pesticides in agricultural crops [9–11]. IoT is one 
of the most recent advancements in wireless communication in radical 
technologies [12]. The fundamental concept is to link a range of physical 
devices to the internet with special addressing patterns. In a variety of 
vertical areas, such as transit, healthcare, industry, cars, smart home, and 
farming, IoT technology can be realistic [13]. IoT devices provide helpful 
information in an agricultural system on a variety of physical restrictions 

 
 
 
126 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
to optimize the farming process [10]. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) 
play an extremely reputable position in IoT technology, as wireless data 
transfer is a key aspect of IoT applications in many markets. 
During the last two decades, the widespread usage of the internet has 
offered boundless advantages to organizations and people throughout the 
world. This achievement was mainly advantaged by the capability to offer 
customer and production services in real-time. The IoT has lately claimed 
to provide its revolutionary breakthroughs to the same advantages by 
altering its operational environment and raising consumer awareness and 
capabilities. In the areas of health, shopping, traffic, defense, intelligent 
homes, smart cities, and agriculture, IoT offers a number of solutions. 
In agriculture, IoT implementation is seen as the optimal solution, since 
continuous monitoring and control is essential in this sector. IoT is seen 
on a variety of occasions within the manufacturing chain of agriculture 
[14]. The framework built is even more interesting in dealing with node 
faults and rearranging the weak connectivity ties on the network on their 
own. In Ref. [15], an IoT management is proposed that tracks wind, soil, 
atmosphere, and water elements across a wide range of areas. In addition, 
IoT-based solutions for agricultural surveillance have been established 
based on their subdomains. Sub-domains listed include soil tracking, 
air surveillance, temperature monitoring, water monitoring, disease 
monitoring, location surveillance, environmental monitoring, insect moni­
toring, and fertilization surveillance [16, 17]. Precision farming, livestock, 
and greenhouses, which are clustered under various surveillance areas, are 
the major applications of IoT in agriculture. The wireless sensor network 
(WSN), which helps farmers collect relevant data via detectors, is used 
to track all these applications with different IoT-based sensors/devices. 
Certain IoT-based settings analyze and process remote data through cloud 
providers, helping scientists and farmers to decide better. Today, envi­
ronmental control systems provide additional management and decision-
making facilities through the development of current technologies. A 
custom landslide Risk Management System has been designed to enable 
fast deployments without user interference in hostile environments [18]. 
Data from various environmental parameters are furthermore conveyed to 
the user by warnings or by message to the authorities [19]. 
The objective of intelligent agriculture is to boost output, yield, and 
profitability by using many approaches, such as effective irrigation, the 
specific and exact application of pesticides and fertilizers on crops, and so 

 
127 
Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
on. Smart agriculture was made feasible by the developing IoT and UAVs. 
In order to ensure that information flows across different devices, such as 
sensors, relays, and gateways, IoT values its data via automated collection, 
translation, and access as a significant technology for intelligent agricul-
ture. This enables smart farms cost-effective and timely production and 
management processes [20]. 
Furthermore, IoT reduces the impact of the intrinsic environment by 
allowing real-time response to infestations such as weeds, detection of 
diseases, weather surveillance and prevention, soils, etc. This facilitates 
the proper exploitation of commodities such as water, nutrients, or agro-
chemicals through UAV and IoT technologies. Moreover, these intelligent 
technologies have enhanced the quality of agricultural output and the envi-
ronmental effects of agriculture. Because IoT and UAV-based intelligent 
agriculture have certain essential properties [21–23]: 
i. 
Field Monitoring: Smart agriculture aims to reduce crop waste by 
improved surveillance, precise data collection and data analysis. 
ii. Intelligent Agricultural Activities: These are designed to iden-
tify the position of animals in huge stables grazing in open spaces. 
Views and tracking: Technology also helps analyze the air quality, 
ventilation, and hazardous waste emissions in farms. 
iii. Greenhouse Applications: Smart agriculture monitors micro-
climate conditions with the goal of improving fruit and vegetable 
production and quality in green houses. 
iv. Biomass Management: Smart farming helps to regulate humidity 
and temperature in crops like grass as a measure for avoiding 
fungus and other microbial pollutants. 
v. Bioenergy Governance: Smart farming is a measure of how to 
prevent fungus and other microbial pollutants in crops like straw 
and grass. 
vi. Intelligent Breeding: It regulates the raising situations and well-
being of offspring in animal farms. 
In addition, the uses of UAVs are diversified, encompassing residential, 
military, trade, and government-related fields [13–18]. Examples include 
environmental control in the civil sector (e.g., pollution, plant health and 
industrial accidents). UAVs are being utilized to monitor and deliver 

 
 
 
 
 
128 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
information at post-catastrophe or disaster sites, and transfer medicines 
and other vital supplies in military and government zones. The delivery 
of commodities and products in both urban and rural regions is consumed 
by commercial uses. As part of IoT, UAVs, which therefore depend on 
sensors, embedded software, and antennas, get a two-way connectivity 
to remote control and monitoring applications [19]. The IoT produces 
a fast-paced cutting-edge environment where a huge number of clever 
things have the main notion to be orchestrated so that either directly by 
users or through specific software collects behavior and ideas are used and 
activated worldwide. With IoT, objects may develop active participants in 
everyday work through various communications technologies with rich 
and potential applications in the context of the “Intelligent City” vision 
[20]. It is predicted that around 30 billion distinct items will be members 
of this global community by 2022. It is expected. With the arrival of 5G 
UAV technology, these projections are projected to increase dramatically. 
The aim of UAVs is to give a wider range of viewpoints in intelligent 
agriculture, for example, with an imagery analysis and agricultural surveil­
lance [24]. Not only do UAVs increase picture analysis and farmland 
processing, but they also make it possible by patrolling the field of interest 
to thoroughly understand the situation [25]. UAVs can also be utilized 
to supply useful information through data transfer to grounded tracking 
stations. UAV usage is expanded in numerous agricultural fields, such 
as pesticide and fertile spraying, seed plantation, weakening of identity, 
fertility assessment, mapping, and planting. UAV is used in numerous 
fields. These recent advances in intelligent IoT and UAV-based agricul­
ture help the world achieve the ‘2030 Sustainable Development Agenda’ 
priorities, where the United Nations (UN) and international communities 
are setting the goal of eliminating hunger by 2030 [26].

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a low-cost option for data analysis 
and sensing technologies in recent years. Fernosensing examines the prop­
erties of a targeted item from a distance through electromagnetic energy, 
and offers the benefits of integrity, non-invasiveness, timeliness, and 
adaptability. Far distant from actual data for remote sensing, agricultural 
productivity, and land [27–29], remote sensing determines soil parameters 
of the farmhouse. UAV can be chosen to obtain precise data according to 

 
 
 
129 
Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
the researchers in the field. It is regarded as a viable technology capable of 
producing high images (<1 m) in high spatial resolution and time, which is 
suited for prompt reactions in the generation of active crop and field infor­
mation [30]. Less costly than traditional handled aircraft, the low altitude 
remote sensing (LARS), the tiny UAV may be one of the key reasons why 
UAV production exceeded market demand [31]. 
However, a UAV is a type of aircraft that functions without an on-board 
human pilot. Different types of UAVs for various purposes exist. Initially, 
the military used technology for the target practice, intelligence, and 
monitoring of certain enemy lands by the anti-aircraft group. However, 
the technology has gone beyond its basic objective and has become more 
important in many sectors of human effort in recent years [32]. Techno­
logical advances have allowed the increased adaption for numerous appli­
cations of unmanned air vehicles. UAVs can be utilized in cattle counting, 
animal observation, and eating behaviors and patterns linked to health 
from a cattle point of view. By using the information collected, farmers 
may give quick and efficient solutions to difficulties and challenges, make 
better management decisions, restore agricultural output, and finally 
generate higher incomes [33, 34]. 
UAV’s advantages are to allow farmer’s crops to hold pictures with a 
variety of camera filters to allow farms with multiple spectral imagery, to 
approve picture treatment and investigation, to provide better information 
about crop health while also recognizing crop areas that require particular 
forms of attention. The little UAV may be simply floated and maintained 
with minimal training, producing a fantastic alternative for farmers moni­
toring their crop expansion by combining farming with remote sensing 
information [33–35]. 
7.4 TYPES OF UAV 
Many concepts may be utilized to obtain a categorization of UAVs [8], 
such as size, maximum take-offs, etc. These will also be taken into account 
in the examination of UAV flight regulation. The categorization has been 
established with the kind and amount of autonomy that would be most 
suitable in the field of agricultural missions [36–39]. 
Two primary sets may be detected depending on the kind of wing: 
rotating and fixing wings. Helicopters and multi-rooters are preparing for 
the first group (usually known as drones). The airflow consists of several 

 
130 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
rotors producing the appropriate lifting confidence. Their key benefit is the 
capability to accomplish aerial photography-enabled hovering flight since 
it enables the capture duration of cameras to be increased and therefore 
unfavorable light conditions reimbursed. The airflow also shows high 
performance at low speeds and is consistent with low-level flights with 
less danger. Due to its mechanical easiness in contrast to helicopters, 
which depend on a much more complex plate control mechanism, multi-
rotor systems have become more common. Therefore, the multi-rotor 
flight can only be detected by changing the speed of numerous direct 
current (DC) engines, unlike helicopters, without a mechanically moving 
machines. Furthermore, a drop in prices for non-maintenance brushless 
engines and associated electronic supervisors has made it cost-effective 
for numerous civil applications responsibilities. As a result, a considerable 
number of drone companies for the provision of a large variety of systems 
came on the market. Commercial drones are mostly inadequate compared 
to helicopters with their lower payload capabilities. However, the number 
of rotors has risen from 4 to 6 or 8 to lessen that gap and drones with a 
maximum cargo capacity of 22 kg are exhibited on the market nowadays 
[40–43]. The cargo capacity not just increases when rotors are in use, 
but safety has developed similarly. Then, when one or more rotors are 
in failure, the aircraft are usually able to fly in a degraded state, allowing 
for safe arrivals. Conversely, fixed wing aircraft such as planes require 
airflow generation to increase aerodynamic surfaces (wing and aileron) 
by moving at high speed. The airplane hence cannot carry out static 
flights. Then, the speed cannot be reduced in the same manner as rotating 
wings, normally they are higher in height for safe flights. Furthermore, 
there is a great advantage over rotating wings to their maneuverability 
(i.e., quick rotations on the Vertical Axis). Due to regulatory requirements 
for flying UAVs, the maximum range for safe wing aircraft is larger than 
rotary wings and, in most scenarios, it does not produce any true benefits 
and yet most aircraft display enhanced load capacity. Consequently, the 
analysis concluded that rotary wings are more favorable than fixed wings 
to agricultural responsibility. 
7.5 IOT FOR SMART AGRICULTURE 
Intelligent farming is a current IoT-based agriculture idea that improves 
agricultural output. Farmers may employ smart agricultural products to 

 
 
 
131 
Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
successfully increase the quality and quantity of their crops by using fertil­
izers and other resources. On the farm 24 hours a day, farmers can’t be 
modern. In addition, farmers could not employ various devices to measure 
the appropriate environmental conditions for their crops. IoT provides 
you an autonomous system that can operate in deprivation of any human 
guidance and can notify you to conclude correctly with regard to various 
problems they experience throughout agriculture. They can spread and 
tell the farmer even if the farmer is not on the ground, thereby enabling 
farmers to cultivate additional farmland. Universal population has been 
expected to reach Mark 9 billion by 2050 [1–5]. IoT applications must 
thus be made for farming so that big populations can sustain themselves 
and use farms and other belongings efficiently, since in certain locations, 
they are rare. Random weather conditions harm crops for global warming, 
and farmers are confronted with losses, thus IoT Smart Farming can take 
immediate steps to prevent this [23–25, 44, 45, 49–51]. 
However, several major apparatuses of IoT based Agriculture exist, like 
sensors, Internet access, wireless communications, data transmission, etc. 
Wireless communications have a significant component to play in effec­
tively organizing IoT systems based on transmission distance, spectrum, 
and scenarios of application. The architecture of IoT is based primarily on 
3 levels, as Figure 7.1 shows; specifically, the Physical layer for sensing, 
the network layer for data transmission contracts and the layer for applica­
tion where data storage and data modification are observed [23]. 
FIGURE 7.1 IoT architecture. 

 
 
132 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
7.5.1 PHYSICAL LAYER 
The hardware layer is comprised of many terminal devices, cameras, 
and sensors; WSNs; labels and readers for radio frequency identification 
(RFID). In this layer, wind speed, temperature, moisture, nutrition level, 
vehicle illnesses, insect infestations, etc., are utilized for assembling 
sensors. Composite information is controlled by the embedded devices 
and is uploaded for further processing and research onto a higher layer. 
These terminals and sensors are utilised for monitoring, monitoring and 
recognition of agriculture and livestock products. WSNs, for example, 
are commonly used for storage and logistics services management and 
monitoring [52]. Further, RFID technologies for networked devices are the 
most important pattern on the other hand. Electronic product code (EPC) 
data is stored using RFID tags which are read, turned on or controlled by 
RFID readers. Thus, in the agricultural arena, WSN technologies, RFID, 
and NFC are utilized to play an important role in item ID, tracking, moni­
toring, monitoring, and data storage on active or passive devices. 
7.5.2 NETWORK LAYER 
Sensors and devices on the network layer are required for connecting to 
the nearby nodes and the gateway to build a network. The sensor nodes at 
this layer co-operate and link to other gateways and nodes in a system to 
transmit data into a remote structure; for important information data are 
preserved, further examined, processed, and distributed [53]. 
7.5.3 APPLICATION LAYER 
The uppermost level of the IoT architecture is the application layer in 
which IoT assists and benefits are external. In this layer, there are lots of 
brilliant phases or systems to monitor and monitor soil, water, and food, 
plants, and livestock. These layers support initial advice and organization 
of illnesses and insect pests, infestation, and agricultural management of 
safety; the result is improved manufacturing efficiency. 
7.6 COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES USED IN IOT-BASED 
SMART AGRICULTURE 
Procedures for wireless communication have been set by wireless proto­
cols and standards. IEEE 802.15.4, for example, is a wireless standard 

 
 
133 
Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
used to connect Internet access gates with the end nodes. In addition, 
Zigbee, Sigfox, EC-GSM, ONE-NET, and ISA100, 11a and LoRaWAN, 
DASH7, etc. [54] are further examples. The standards are grouped into 
transmission ranges given in Figure 7.2 [55]. 
FIGURE 7.2 IoT-based smart agricultural classification of communication technologies. 
IEEE 802.15.4-based protocols are the perfect choice [53] for wireless 
short distance applications, which is designed for broad-area networks 
with low energy (LPWANs). This data rate is from 20 kbps to 250 kbps 
and operates with a maximum outside viewing line (LoS) range of 100 
m [56], and works with multiple frequency bands such as 433 MHz, 868 
MHz, 91.5 and 2.4 GHz. For applications that are critical for medium-
range communication the competing IEEE 802.11 standard are suitable. 
IEEE 802.11p is also an alternative to integrate high mobility conditions. 
The wide range of communication, legal maximum transmission 
power of 1 W and the less disturbed 5.9 GHz ISM [50] appear to give this 
particular problem a great deal of attention in agricultural situations. Long 
distance communication technology is the only reliable and anticipated 
answer when it comes to coverage. The most suitable and reliable standard 
for precision farms in cellular communication technologies like as 3G, 4G, 
LTE, and 5G are large volumes of real-time data required for transmission 
and processing [57]. The 5G communication technology may also be used 
for delivering communication between devices in real-time and the device 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
134 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
(D2D) to enable for the positioning of vehicles. In addition, a huge number 
of equipment per square kilometer may be maintained [58]. Unlike LTE, 
5G may be enabled on advanced frequency bands so that greater channel 
bandwidths may be used. 5G communication technologies, especially in 
rural regions, can enable the development of new capacity in agricultural 
equipment by providing greater data rates and broader transmission ranges 
according to the real-time connection model. The cellular network’s 
obtainability and the economic potential of 5G technology in rural regions, 
however, are of debatable concern. 
The most consistent of IoT future communication technologies are 
LoRa/LoRaWAN and IEEE 802.11ah. In addition, the major is an IEEE 
802.11 family change, which was accessible in 2017 to provision IoT 
configurations like smart monitoring [50]. The situation usages 900 MHz 
bands and provides broader exposure and uses less than IEEE 802.15.4 
energy. It connects 1,000 tactics across a one-kilometer radius with a single 
access point. LoRaWAN is another more favorable LPWAN standard for a 
battery-operated wireless node system. 
Cellular communication approaches from 2G to 4G can be appropriate, 
dependent on the purpose and bandwidth necessity; however, the depend­
ability, and even accessibility, of a cellular network in rural areas is a main 
apprehension. To overcome this, data transmission through satellite is 
another choice. However, the cost of this communication mechanism is 
high in this case is very high, which creates it not appropriate for small- 
and medium-sized farms. The superior of communication mode also be 
contingent on application requirements, like some farms require sensors 
that can activate with low data rate but necessary to work for long periods 
therefore requires long battery life. For such situations, a new choice of 
low power wide area network (LPWAN) is selected as a better resolution 
for cellular connectivity, not only in positions of long battery life but also 
in positions of a larger connectivity choice with reasonable rates [59]. 
Currently, the management of crops and pastures is one of the primary 
applications in which LPWAN networks are suitable for many additional 
agricultural uses. 
In addition, a common communication label allows UAVs to connect 
with Ground Control Station for UAV farming (MAVLink) (GCS). It links 
up between the platform calculation, UAV monitoring platform and the 
GCS application platform [60]. MAVLink is used for transmitting direc­
tions, global satellite navigation system (GNSS) position and UAV speed. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
135 
Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
The space of communication between the UAV and the GCS is subject to 
UAV circumstances. On the other hand, when the UAV is located inside the 
LOS it may link up to 2 km [61]. At present, UAVs are scheduled for re-start 
mode, so that when communication is disrupted, the UAVs may immediately 
return to its first location. This approach is used to stop undesirable inci­
dents or UAV losses [24, 62, 63]. Also available for GCS and UAVs, such 
as ZigBee, radio-frequency modules, and other communicators, are a few 
different types of communications systems. By using other technologies, 
such as phone applications, the communication range may be increased. The 
arrival of 5G mobile technology, will be very useful to plot high definition in 
order to restore infrastructure and data processing rates [64, 65]. 
7.7 UAV FOR SMART AGRICULTURE 
Nowadays, in various industries, including farming areas, the IoT system 
has made great growth. But communication services such as basic stations 
or Wi-Fi are highly inadequate when taking on agriculture which restrict 
the development of the IoT industry. Their arrangements for communica­
tion and related facilities in emerging countries and rural regions, one of 
the primary gaps in the IoT business, are significantly worse. In the lack 
of reliable communication arrangements, the data produced by the wire­
less sensors cannot be transferred. In such a case, UAVs are making an 
alternative method. In the course of data processing and inquiry, the UAV 
system interfaces with the wireless sensors over great distances. The UAV, 
also known as drones, was widely used amongst the most precious innova­
tions in smart agriculture [25, 66]. Drones or UAVs are widely utilized 
by farmers for observation and control of farm growth. Some UAVs are 
sprayed, others are very insecticidal in the rugged terrain when human 
mobility is not possible and crops keep different heights. 
In addition, UAVs, better known as drones, may be flown over thou­
sands of hectares in the fields, fastened with high-resolution cameras 
and accurate sensors. In the fields of forestry and crop observation, in 
particular, the investigational function for wide zones in all agricultural 
applications is quite serious [67]. A rapid, low-cost, real, and comprehen­
sive monitoring of accurate data acquisition and broadcasting is therefore 
essential for agriculture. Currently, aerial photos from a field or a farm 
zone are usually employed by two choices: satellite and aircrew. Both 
options are suitable for a scenic view, but when it comes to PC views, the 

 
 
 
136 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
options confront serious challenges with their qualities. These pictures are 
not respectable in resolution and do not give image quality that is essential 
throughout the inquiry. In addition, it is also difficult to acquire pictures 
regularly and the frequency of visits is difficult. In addition to this, it is 
another serious concern because controls outside the cloud are likely to be 
crowded in a harsh environment. 
But UAV is an eye-in-heaven platform that resolves or eliminates 
the previously mentioned micro-vision difficulties. The photographs 
occupied by the UAV are generally much better than satellite photos in 
their worth depending on the included camera resolution and, in particular, 
regulate according to applications. UAVs maintain quicker, quicker and 
more advantaged NDVI to evaluate agricultural conditions such as weed 
mapping, leaf evaluations, etc., and to provide farmers with immediate 
reaction in good time. Depending on the frequency of the UAV, even if you 
wish it several times in one day, and if it is not rains it will alter weather 
conditions. UAVs are considered as the future of precision farming because 
of the advantages indicated. 
Not only incalculability but also UAVs are required to deliver hefty 
payloads in specific applications of pesticide and fertilizer. This makes 
efficient battery utilization crucial for spreading flight duration in such 
conditions. Many characteristics may be examined to improve the effi­
ciency of the drone in this resolution. At first, pick the proper circumstances 
for your flight, e.g., air or climatic direction. In the end, try to include and 
correctly put optimal payloads. In order to do this, the payload can be 
allocated near the field, improved in small numbers, and refilled again for 
heavy amounts. In addition, optimal path choice has a major significance, 
depending on area size and frequency of visitors. Many routing designs 
for this resolution, such as in Refs. [59, 60], are planned especially for 
UAVs, such that the choice and implementation of the proper arrangement 
can make significant changes. New activities such as the tethering system 
can assist the spraying of pesticide and UAV-based crops in which drones 
are important for flying heavy payloads. In UAV tying, the connector 
provides power via the long connection so that, as long as the farmers have 
electricity on the field, hefty batteries don’t have to be lifted most of all. 
Currently, farming is regarded one of the most successful areas in which 
UAVs can offer several answers to a number of major and long-term chal­
lenges. Below are some major applications where drones already play key 
roles in support of farmers by means of the system concept.

Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
7.8 APPLICATIONS OF IOT AND UAV IN SMART AGRICULTURE 
THROUGH SYSTEM MODEL 
In numerous applications of intelligent agriculture, IoT, and UAVs may 
be used. This section discusses several IoT and UAV applications through 
system models in intelligent agriculture: 
1. Smart Crop Monitoring: Crop surveillance indicates that 
particular agricultural restrictions are adequately sensed. One of 
the key elements of intelligent agriculture is automatic observa-
tion. Spontaneously positioned sensors can senses and transmit 
data to a gateway for further research and control. Cutting limita-
tions including leaf area index [68], plant height, color, form, sheet 
sizes [69], etc., are monitored using sensors. IoT and UAV are also 
convenient in controlling soil moisture [70, 71]; agriculture water 
constraints like pH level [72]; and also, climate parameters like 
wind speed, Wind direction, precipitation, radiation, wind direc-
tion, air pressure, temperature, relative humidity, etc. [73, 74]. 
Remote sensing is also quite efficient in its presence. Due to the 
triviality of sensors, distant sensors are connected in lower UAV 
altitudes and may therefore efficiently and efficiently regulate 
crops. High resolution recordings are therefore accomplished by 
eliminating various forms of artificial conditions, such as weather. 
2. Smart Pest Management: Pest control usually relies on three 
characteristics: sensing, assessing, and therapy. The state-of-
the-art infections and pest assessment processing techniques are 
determined by employing UAVs or remote sensing satellites to 
create raw images across the crop zone. Remote sensor protection 
often provides wide ranges, consequently offering lesser cost for 
increased production. UAV IoT sensors, on the other hand, are 
employed for the maintenance in each angle of the crop series of 
other data assembly capabilities such as environmental sampling, 
plant health, and plague. 
3. Smart Irrigation: Agricultural UAVs with cameras are capable 
of giving excellent perceptions of the particular areas affected. 
The farmer is able to control low-soil humidity areas, dehydrous 

 
138 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
crops, and water-logged regions by means of cameras and, in 
general, is an understanding of the overall health status of the 
agricultural crops. Either traditional farming, inappropriately 
carried out or extremely costly, such accurate observation was 
not likely as professionals were recruited in order to carry out the 
work and achieve satisfying answers. At now, however, UAVs 
help farmers to arrange them themselves. They offer added 
benefits. 
4. Livestock Monitoring (Animal Husbandry): Livestock moni-
toring is nowadays a very tough part of agriculture, which engage 
a very large number of labor efficiency, which cause drawback 
of cost-effectiveness. In this IoT enable 5G drone it is possible 
to take remotely surveillance on livestock monitoring. The inter-
ests of a growing number of scientists have drawn unmanned 
air vehicles (UAVs), as an agricultural tool. We examine in this 
research the challenge of deploying UAVs to track and monitor 
cattle such as bovine animals and ovine animals in pastures. We 
presume that all targeted animals have GPS collars and cannot 
disregard the movement of any targeted animal. In addition, the 
number of UAVs covering the whole pasture is assumed and 
we strive to discover the ideal deployment of UAVs to mini-
mize the average distance between animals. First, we introduce 
a sweeping coverage technique using UAVs. With UAVs, the 
initial positions of all targeted animals may be gathered to cover 
the whole pasture. Then decide and update the deployment of 
the UAV by streaming a k-means clustering based on the original 
positions. 
5. Forecasting: Projections are the primary characteristics of intel-
ligent farming that give real-time data and previous information 
to estimate and compute certain critical parameters. Scientific 
demonstration and machine learning are samples of devices that 
work for prediction. UAV provides different machine learning 
models like the regression model for approximating phosphorus 
amount in the soil [48], forecasting moisture of soil or detection 
of plant disease [47], Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting 
temperatures of the field [46], etc.

Applications of IoT and UAV in Smart Agriculture 
7.8.1 SYSTEM MODEL 
IoT is an emerging cutting-edge technology, which is dealing with different 
multidisciplinary Engineering frameworks for domestic or commercial 
Automation libraries. If we consider 3 Gateways as such gateway1, 
gateway2, gateway3, … If we follow OSI model over here network layers 
are to be more concentrated. Three gateways are enough to optimize the 
network traffic for user to UAV band and vice versa. After sensing data 
transmitted through gateway to online cloud server and from the client 
machine (mobile, tablet, computer) it may be accessed through different 
portal with real-time readings (Figure 7.3). 
FIGURE 7.3 System model. 
7.9 CONCLUSIONS 
This chapter shows many uses of intelligent agriculture, benefits, and the 
use of IoT and UAV in agriculture, the diverse methods of communication, 
and acknowledges the connection challenges and limitations of IoT and 
UAVs in distant locations. The chapter described the limits on connection 
in terms of communication and transmission technologies. Moreover, the 
chapter demonstrates the application of IoT and UAV for smart agriculture 
through a system model.

ABSTRACT 
The rapidly advancing needs for scalable technologies which accommo­
date and handle the huge data inspired the idea of the Cloud. In Cloud 
systems, the services, platforms, or infrastructure are provided to the 
client as a service based on the requirements specified. The main element 
that connects the client and the virtual cloud is the data which is to be 
saved in or accessed from the cloud. The major concern around this data 
flow and cloud interaction is the security, privacy of the data which is in 
transit or at rest. The traditional approaches to secure a system are through 
the enforcement of the cryptographic algorithms, whose backbone is the 
complex mathematics and the functions which are computationally costly 
to decode. But as we advance as a modern generation of technology with 
upgraded computing capabilities such as quantum computing, the idea of 

 
148 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
securing systems on the basis of computationally hard problems is not 
completely secure as quantum computation emerges as a threat to the 
pure cryptosystems. This prompts to the necessity of developing hybrid 
cryptosystems, which are more secure than the pure cryptosystems. In this 
chapter, we present a comparative analysis between various traditional 
cryptosystems and hybrid cryptosystems considering the factors such as 
the length of the key or cipher and the time for encryption and decryp­
tion. In this chapter, we also present a study of various security enhancing 
concepts, such as (i) machine learning and deep learning-based methods; 
(ii) quantum cryptography methods; and (iii) post-quantum cryptography 
concepts, which secure the cloud ecosystem despite the threats posed due 
to emergence of quantum computers or supercomputers. This chapter aims 
to contribute to the domain knowledge of cloud security and the different 
ways to enhance it. 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
Cloud computing is a newly emerged technology with extensive scope 
of advancement. Initially, the time-sharing concept-based data centers 
assigned the tasks (Jobs) to the mainframe of the companies. During this 
period, the Jobs were submitted by the user to the operator directly. As the 
technology advanced, the companies began using VPN-based networks 
(virtual private network). The general notion was thought the demarcation 
in such systems between the end users and the servers was a cloud. With 
experimentations and using more optimized algorithms, the computing 
power and scalability of this cloud was further expanded, this was the 
beginning of the cloud computing revolution. The main notion of intro­
ducing this technology was the competent usage of the resources for the 
end user even at a lower bandwidth [1–4]. Many believe that the idea 
of providing computation as a utility was for the first time proposed by 
scientist John McCarthy [5] who introduced the novel idea of renting of 
the computing resources, which are time shared services, to the companies 
which were financially incapable of affording these technologies. Cloud 
mainly offers the service of storing and providing on-demand access 
to data over the internet. The utility rate of cloud services is expanding 
exponentially as the contemporary paradigm of technology is about data 
revolution. In the IT industry, the term was first popularized by Amazon 
releasing their product “Elastic Compute Cloud” in 2006 which changed 

 
 
149 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
the perspective of “Providing a Service.” Cloud Services provide on 
demand the infrastructure, platform, and software as a service (SaaS). Idea 
of Cloud Computing is inspired from the Client-Server model as even in 
cloud architectures there is a client, who requests for the services and a 
Server (cloud service provider) who processes the requests. Figure 8.1 
depicts the high-level graphical view of cloud computing architectures. 
FIGURE 8.1 Cloud ecosystem. 
8.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD 
The main attributes of cloud architectures are: 
1. Multitenancy: The Centralized Infrastructure is shared between 
numbers of users. Though the Infrastructure is shared between 
multiple users in an instance of time, the tenants (users) data is 
stored in isolation and hence is inaccessible to the other users. 

 
150 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
2. Scalability: System’s ability to increase the capacity of the 
workload without changing the existing hardware resources. Scal-
ability is possible in cloud architectures as these cloud services 
depend upon VM to be hosted in the user’s machine. These VM 
are upgraded according to the requirements. Based on workload 
the VM can be shifted to a different server or are hosted over 
multiple servers at a given instant of time. Thus, a better system 
performance can be obtained with existing hardware resources in 
real. This is static upgradation of system. 
3. Elasticity: System’s ability to accommodate the changing work-
load dynamically. An elastic system automatically adapts to the 
change. This is dynamic upgradation of system. This is beneficial 
when there is a rapid upsurge in the workload or traffic, but even-
tually the upsurge would stabilize after a point of time. In such a 
scenario, if too many or too few resources are allocated then either 
there can be a draft of resources or the resources remaining idle 
for a long period of time. By this dynamic upgradation we ensure 
the resource usage is in complete accordance with the load or the 
demand. 
As the computing requirements upsurge, the focus of cloud service 
providers is to provide services which are comfortable according to 
requirements and user-friendly. In a user-friendly system, user is less 
bothered about the technicalities related to the structure and working of 
the cloud, making it a more secure platform for user’s huge amount of 
data. To increase the quality of the services and infrastructure provided by 
the cloud, its attributes are expanded for better quality of service to make 
it more user responsive. But these expansions can lead to compromising 
on security matters. 
8.2 SECURITY IN CLOUD 
Cloud computing contributes to an age where data is stored majorly in 
cloud servers rather than the local systems. There are chunks of data lying 
in cloud habitats. This data is of great importance, when a data breach or 
unauthorized access to data can lead to a huge loss to user. Despite cloud 
being a boon to the majority of storage problems today are prone to the 
vulnerabilities relating to security, as we come across real incidents where 

 
151 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
the technology and computing capabilities are misused to intrude cloud 
or to breach data while it is transported to the cloud. The discussion about 
security concern is illustrated in the diagram in Figure 8.2 [6]. 
From Figure 8.2, it is evident that critical issues in the cloud eco-
system are related to security incidents. Hence an emphasis is laid to 
address security-related dynamics of user’s data. As we discuss the criti-
cality of data security, it is primary responsibility of every CSP to protect 
clients’ data in cloud and there should be some authentication schemes or 
mechanisms that govern the granting of the access to that data. The client 
data safety and proper practices and privacy policies are to be validated to 
assure cloud users of data safety and privacy protection. So, huge invest-
ment is obvious for the maintenance of security and privacy in the cloud. 
The path for the transmission of data through cloud interactions is the 
internet. The general schemes or protocols like HTTP are unsafe to be 
used. But even today, there are applications in which the API requests are 
sent via a HTTP protocol. Hence using such unsafe protocols to transmit 
data over the internet can pose threat to the integrity and confidentiality of 
data. In present-day there are intruders and hackers who try to penetrate 
through the CSP firewall and steal or hamper users’ data. This data breach 
can be very costly to the user and to the CSP. Data either in static (at Rest/ 
Stored in the cloud) or in transit (Being Transferred to the cloud) is valu-
able and of great use. Based on hacking motives, various researchers have 
proposed variety techniques, to protect security during communication, 
but the conventional methods fail to ensure complete security. Type of 
mechanism used for protection depends on the size and nature of data. The 
diverse datatypes in a cloud ecosystem are [7]: 
i. 
Transit Data: Data in transmission channels between cloud and user. 
ii. Data at Rest: The static data stored in the cloud. 
iii. Data in Processing: Data being processed in the server. 
iv. Data Lineage: Data history which is stored in the warehouses. 
v. 
Data Provenance: History of derivation of data. 
vi. Data Remanence: The problem of the possibility of recovering 
the deleted files due to the magnetic properties of the storage 
medium.

In recent times the hacking became a popular profession. National 
Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST), an agency of United States 
Department of Commerce, organizes events or competitions in which 
different security schemes are attacked, based on results the best ones are 
decided and the loopholes of the other proposed mechanisms (algorithms) 
are noted. So, when we look at these scenarios, we realize there is an 
alarming need for security, the necessity that we change the perspective 
towards technology that ensures security by strengthening it to protect 
systems from attacks or intruders. There is continuous critical debate for 
changing of security outlook of cloud technologies and more matured 
emphasis should be laid on this matter [8]. Even the giant companies who 
invest huge in making their network foolproof and potentially resistant to 
the attacks of the hackers, also contract to these cyber-attacks leading to 
tampering of data, leaking of data or data stealing. To understand cyber­
attacks, these are categorized them into major 11 attacks by cloud Security 
Alliance which are: data breaches, misconfigured system, inability of have 
potential maintenance of credentials, hijacking, insider threat, insecure api 
endpoints, structural failures, limited cloud usage visibility, abusive usage 
of cloud services. 
8.3 DATA SECURITY CHALLENGES 
For secure cloud, there is a requirement to comprehend data security 
challenges. A systematic analysis of challenges is indispensable to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
153 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
achieve the objective of making cloud highly secure. Towards this clas­
sification of various challenges involved at multiple levels to implement 
attack resistant security system through proper technological approach is 
inescapable. 
8.3.1 VIRTUALIZATION 
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version or a virtual plat­
form of a server, a device, or a resource. In simple terms, virtualization 
is the logical division that can support in usage of resources and services 
through time sharing. Generally, to facilitate process of the virtualization 
hypervisors are involved on host machines to run guest operating systems. 
So, ensure that hypervisor is not vulnerable because the failure in proper 
functioning, hypervisor can lead to the collapse of entire process and thus 
endanger data. Another risk involved is if hypervisor fails to maintain 
proper mechanism to maintain proper allocation and de-allocation of the 
resources then there is a possibility that after one of Virtual Machines 
(Virtual Machine-Guest machine) access is ceased and if resources are 
still available on the system, then is available to next VM running and 
these prior resources to current VM may be of no importance. But data is 
obtainable to the current VM which has no need of it, so this instance of 
data privacy disruption. There can be many security and privacy breaches 
in data at the virtualization level. And if the hypervisor is compromised 
if the hacker also gains root permission, then this would lead the hacker 
having full access to all the resources and operations. This is resolved 
by having strong authentication before allocation and de-allocation of the 
resources. 
8.3.2 MULTITENANCY 
There are shared resources between multiple users simultaneously. So, 
there exists a possibility that the private data of one user gets leaked and 
is accessible by any other user. And this condition can be very sensitive 
to the motives of the hackers. Authenticating users before providing them 
the access to cloud resources is vital. And another trouble that arises due to 
multitenancy is: access of data, belonging to a user, shouldn’t be granted 
to another user. Potentially attacks are carried by implementing malicious 

 
 
 
 
154 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
code over users end, and the access permissions can be reset. Hence, user 
would be entitled to access other user’s resources. Hence it becomes an 
un-ignorable requirement that we store data in segregation. Generally, data 
segregation vulnerabilities can be detected by performing testing like Injec­
tion attacks (SQL). 
8.3.3 STATIVITY, TRANSITIVITY, AND REMINISCE OF DATA 
Data saved in the cloud is static, and because it is maintained on a server 
(cloud) for an extended period of time, maintaining data accuracy is critical. 
Transit data is information that travels from and to the cloud. Usernames 
and passwords are the most common types of transit data, and they are 
always sent to the cloud via APIs. As a result, data must be safeguarded 
while going via a network for authentication, and this is done utilizing the 
various encryption techniques. The main encryption techniques pass the 
credentials via authentication schemes like Session-based authentication or 
the token-based authentications. The backbone technology and algorithms 
that govern mentioned schemes are the Cryptographic algorithms. Data 
reminisce relates to the problems of storages in which even if file has been 
deleted from file system and the trash permanently, it can still be present or 
are fetched again by recovering. This problem exists as magnetic proper­
ties of storage mediums support retrieval. So, capability to access deleted 
files is very dangerous to the security of the system. Consider older logs or 
files, which contain important information, were deleted but these files are 
accessible and entire information about previous logging and transactions 
is now open and vulnerable to exposure. 
8.3.4 LOCATION TRANSPARENCY 
Rather than physical location, the resources are identified based on network 
configuration. However, this poses a security risk because intruders can 
alter network settings. 
8.3.5 INTEROPERABILITY 
Different cloud systems collaborate and connect to work together, which is 
referred to as interoperability. Data services of collaborating cloud systems 
are also accessible to interconnected systems. They also have a firm grasp 

 
 
 
 
 
 
155 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
on other systems’ authentication procedures, formats, and so on, and as 
the need for interconnected clouds grows, there is an alarming need to 
respond to these security issues of interoperability in order to assure safe 
inter-cloud systems [10]. Hence to transcend the aforementioned chal­
lenges, we try to secure data communication channels between cloud and 
user. Additionally, to ensure foolproof security, arises a necessity that data 
being transmitted over the channels is encrypted. Cryptography, powerful 
technique, which supports and resolves issue of security by encrypting 
data. Cryptography encrypts data making it terribly difficult to understand 
without reversing the encryption, i.e., decrypting data. This nature of cryp­
tography makes data breach hard even to the hacker. Even if hacker gains 
access to data and steal it, the hacked information is incomprehensible 
until it is decrypted and converted back to its original format. So, in such 
conditions, despite data hacking, no information is revealed to hacker. In 
the next section, let us overview Cryptography relevant techniques and 
their applications in securing cloud architectures. 
8.4 CRYPTOGRAPHY AND CLOUD SECURITY 
8.4.1 CRYPTOGRAPHY: OVERVIEW 
Cryptography can be understood as the study and practice of the secure 
communication techniques in a scenario involving adversaries like pres­
ence of the third parties. Systems which implement the cryptographic 
techniques to offer data security services are termed as the “cryptosys­
tems.” There are mainly two types of cryptosystems: 
i. 
Secret-Key Cryptography (SKC) 
(Symmetric encryption) 
ii. Public-Key Cryptography (PKC) 
(Asymmetric encryption) 
SKC uses a single key for encryption and decryption of data. Contrast­
ingly, PKC uses two types of keys: public-key, private-key. Cloud service 
providers utilize public key to encrypt user data and this key is acces­
sible to all in public domain, whereas private-key is utilized by users for 
decrypting the encrypted data back into its real form, this key is offered

privately by CSPs to user using cloud service. Secret-key algorithms are as 
well called symmetric algorithms while Public-key algorithms are as well 
called asymmetric algorithms. 
8.4.2 CRYPTOGRAPHIC STORAGE IN CLOUD: OVERVIEW 
In cryptographic storage system, there are three checkpoints in the imple-
mentation [7]: 
• Data processor; 
• Data verifier; and 
• Token generator. 
The process followed in a cryptographic storage system is: When 
user tries to upload to cloud, it is first uploaded to data Processor which 
encrypts data and is then stored in cloud, in encrypted form. For integ-
rity validation during an upload or a retrieval, data Verifier is used. The 
Token Generator generates the token which is sent via request to access 
files. If this token is the legitimate one then, permitted to access and 
retrieve the files. 
8.4.3 CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUTHENTICATION IN CLOUD: OVERVIEW 
SAML standard to authenticate users is extensively used by cloud 
providers. The SAML standards is single sign-on technology (SSO) in 
which user is authenticated once and these authentication credentials are 
later communicated to other applications hosted in cloud or the server. The 
working of the SAML involves three parties: 
1. Principal/Subject: User requesting to access cloud-hosted 
application. 
2. Identity Provider: A service whose prime responsibility is to 
authenticate user, manage the action associating to the authentica-
tion and to store user’s identity. 
3. Service Provider: A cloud-based application, which user 
intends to use. Every hosted application may have its own 
authentication. So, generally when a user tries to access a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
157 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
particular service, they are expected to provide credentials to 
every application. But through the SAML standard once authen­
ticated through SSO, user does not have to re-authenticate them 
through the authentication systems of every individual service 
which they desire to use. 
These authentication standards are backed up the cryptographic algo­
rithms (mainly AES-256). The rise in awareness and concerns regarding 
information security in cloud computing, usage of security algorithms 
in system processes related to security of data has increased manifold. 
Cryptographic algorithms play a pivotal role in offering security to data in 
cloud computing. The unauthorized users are incapable of accessing data 
as these algorithms hide it from them. There are algorithms which play a 
significant role in the encryption of data. The next section presents brief 
insight about different aspects of cryptographic encryption algorithms is 
presented. 
8.5 CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS 
IN CLOUD SECURITY 
8.5.1 
SECRET-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY (SKC) 
At the time of encryption and decryption, just a single key is used in these 
techniques. The symmetric key is kept by both the CSP and the user. As a 
result, the main problem here is implementing key dispersal. This cannot 
assure safe key transfer over an insecure channel, since there are no unique 
keys for the user or the CSP. As a result, it’s difficult to keep track of 
data transfers. We can only identify the activity; it is impossible to follow 
or trace who performed what action during the data transaction process. 
Popular SKC algorithms are reviewed next, as well as their new applica­
tion to the security arena. 
8.5.1.1 DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARDS (DES) 
DES stands for data encryption standards. This algorithm is a popular 
encryption algorithm. It operates on 64-bit sized plain text blocks and 
returns cipher text blocks of identical size. The key-length is initially 64 
bits but as the algorithm processes, every 8th bit is discarded to form 56 
bits long key. This has four modes of operations. This is implemented 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
158 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
based on Feistel block ciphers [12]. In this method, permutations of the 
texts are tried and form boxes on which various iterations of encryption 
is performed. This method is defenseless to many powerful attacks. 
Zameer et al. [18] proposed a system in which audio steganography 
was carried out by building a model built on DES algorithm. In current 
work, audio is first encrypted using DES algorithm, and then from 
the encrypted text every LSB of each byte is made zero. The entire 
information of 8 bits is hidden in the LSB. In the encoding stage, firstly 
size of audio file is encoded, based on computed size length number, 
the decoder fetches same numbers of corresponding LSB bits from 
remaining length of data. The gathered LSB bits are decoded and then 
the message is decrypted for the original message. The result interprets 
that a secured level of steganography is done of the audio, but the 
quality is highly dependent on the size of the audio file. This type of 
steganography could be implemented to store data on a cloud server. 
Through these types of techniques, we ensure that data is masked by 
some other data form making it tough to even identify the original 
data which is valuable. Such masking of information is done based on 
numerous types of algorithms. 
8.5.1.2 ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES) 
Advanced encryption standard (AES) is a symmetric-key encryption 
standard in cryptography that is also used to secure cloud data. It was 
founded in 2001 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST). The block size of each cipher is 128 bits, while the key sizes are 
128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively. AES algorithm was discovered as a 
complement to DES, as its working mechanism was similar but the prior 
one performed better on security standards relatively to the later one. 
AES is an algorithm implemented at both hardware and software levels. 
This algorithm provides broader scope for developers and researchers to 
contribute the mathematical modifications/deviations in the algorithm 
making it deployable for service requirements. Vishwanath et al. [11] 
proposed and implemented a security system built on RSA and AES 
algorithms as this was a hybrid cryptography-based system its perfor­
mance was better than the pure cryptographic systems (based solely 
either on RSA or AES). Considering a grouping of security algorithms 
makes the system immune to vulnerabilities.

8.5.1.3 BLOWFISH 
Blowfish [1] is a symmetric key block cipher created by Bruce Schneier 
in 1993. It takes into account a 64-bit block size as well as varied key 
lengths ranging from 32 to 448 bits. It employs a 16-round festal cipher 
block with unusually big key-based s-boxes. Smarajit et al. [12] created 
a solution that uses a weighted hybrid blowfish algorithm to strengthen 
cloud security. The proposed way to state provides data central authority 
and protection in semi-trusted Service Provider scenarios. 
8.5.2 PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY (PKC) 
This cryptography was primarily created to support two-party communica­
tion, i.e., safeguarding communication across an insecure channel by the 
correct encryption of randomly generated session keys, which are normally 
encrypted with the public key and decrypted with the private key. Both 
keys are linked mathematically. However, knowing one key does not make 
it possible to know the other. The behavior of the mathematical functions 
employed in PKC makes obtaining the inverse of functions computation­
ally highly difficult and time-consuming. As a result, we may maintain 
security by employing two distinct but related keys, notwithstanding the 
computational overhead. Because distinct keys are utilized, it’s simple to 
keep track of cloud transactions because the encryption and decryption 
operations are done by separate keys. 
8.5.2.1 RSA ALGORITHM 
Three mathematicians, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, 
proposed this technique in 1977. The name RSA is taken from the first 
letters of the author’s names. This is used in systems where symmetric 
keys or digital signature authentications must be exchanged. The RSA 
algorithm is asymmetric and public-key. RSA is a three-step block cipher 
that involves key creation, encryption, and decryption. For RSA, NIST 
recommends using keys of a length of 2,048 bits. More advantages include 
the fact that this is a homomorphic encryption technology in terms of 
arithmetic operations. That means that if any arithmetic operations are 
performed on cipher text, the result is a cipher text, which when decrypted 

 
 
 
160 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
is equivalent to (result of an operation performed on simple text). The 
result is a new cipher text that, when decoded, is equivalent to operations 
performed on plain text [14]. As concerns about cloud security grow, secu­
rity systems are being constructed around the concept of homomorphic 
schemes, in which data is decrypted only by the owner of the private 
key. Because data transfers and access to requested data are delivered in 
encrypted form, this strategy is appropriate for cloud environments. The 
danger of the plain text being accessed by an intruder being managed. 
In recent years, the scope of homomorphic encryption has expanded to 
include logical operations, as demonstrated, and proposed by Yi-Fan et 
al. [14]. In this chapter, composite order bilinear groups are used to make 
the scheme homomorphic in terms of logical operations such as ‘AND’ 
and ‘OR’ operators. Plain text is translated to ASCII values before being 
turned to a bit string. And now this bit string is treated as the decimal 
quantity ‘M,’ which is a very large number in general. 
Vishwanath et al. [15] showed implementing a security system founded 
on RSA. In currently referring work, security system was applied in two 
modules: Uploading and Downloading. Where a key generation mechanism 
was designed to generate secret key from RSA and AES. The keys stayed 
with the user. Whenever user intends to upload or download, authentica­
tion is done based on these keys. RSA proves as a competent security 
algorithm but has a few limitations like its nature being deterministic, 
i.e., if the prime numbers are known, then other security parameters and 
keys could be computed easily. The mathematical and the computational 
difficulty for the Cryptanalysis is introduced in the step where the chosen 
prime numbers are being computed and checked. Another limitation of 
this conventional algorithm is that its operations are homomorphic hence 
generally even if algorithm is implemented multiple times on same plain 
text, output remains same. A consequence of this behavior is, encryption 
schemes are vulnerable to Chosen Cipher Attacks. For initiating Chosen 
Cipher Attacks, cryptologists gather the information involving the decryp­
tions for various plaintext, then based on collected information of distinct 
sets of plain texts and their decryptions, they compute secret keys. But 
these limitations are overcome if different encryptions can be generated for 
plain-text for every encryption over the same data. This is attained by the 
padding of the plain texts with padding schemes like OAEP, Selvakumar 
et al. [16] proposed a padding technique called the optimal asymmetric 
encryption padding (OAEP), used to pad RSA algorithm to improve safety 

 
 
 
 
161 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
standards of the system. This model concludes that the OAEP resists the 
attack on cipher texts. 
The main application of this algorithm is to encrypt session keys 
generated at random by systems that are supported by the SKC or hash 
function-based security algorithms, i.e., for example in simple terms the 
public-private keys are used to protect process of distribution of symmetric 
keys if system has a SKC based security system. This algorithm works 
efficiently because the selected p and q are very big; hence it’s very diffi­
cult to computationally evaluate public key and private key just out of 
‘n’ as finding prime factors of any big number is computationally very 
costly. The problem of finding the prime factors for a given large number 
complexity wise is a hard problem. 
8.5.2.2 ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY (ECC) 
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric cryptography algo­
rithm. The algorithms proposed before were mainly the RSA based once, 
i.e., based on integer factorization problem (IFP) problem. But as the 
technology is advancing, we need stronger algorithms. Then came few 
algorithms that were based on stronger and highly complex mathematical 
concepts like the discrete logarithmic problems (DLP) based EIgamal 
cryptosystems [17] but later the need arises for more stronger system so 
led to divert focal point of cryptographers to mathematics of the Elliptic 
curves. 
ECC is based on the mathematical problem of elliptic curve discrete 
logarithm problem (ECDLP) that is more complex to solve than the IFP 
or DLP. Currently, there is absence of computationally viable methods to 
find answer to ECDLP-based problems. There are two keys involved: (i) 
public key, and (ii) private key. 
Comparatively to the other types of PKC algorithms proposed until 
then ECC demonstrated to be additionally efficient over them. It is algo­
rithm consuming variable length based key encryption. And major gain 
was, ECC consumed shorter bandwidth for transmitting smaller sized 
encrypted messages. So, the bandwidth is saved assuring the probability 
of losing data is less [15]. Alowolodu et al. [4] in his work suggested 
means of using ECC for securing data over cloud platforms. But in cloud 
environment data integrity of blocks is hard to be confirmed or checked at 

 
 
 
162 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
users end since data is huge and generally application users lack the tech­
nical knowledge for the validations. So, to tackle this limitation, a model 
was proposed which involved third-party verifiers in systems. Syam et al. 
[18] proposed a study that used ECC and Sobol techniques to verify the 
correctness of data saved in the cloud. This project provided a safe storage 
mechanism for checking the data integrity of blocks by selecting them at 
random from a cloud server. Because most users lack technical skills, the 
approach includes a third-party validator other than the user and the CSR 
who checks for data integrity and safekeeping in place of the users. This 
strategy ensures a user-friendly and secure environment. 
Cryptographic algorithms are traditionally the conventional algo­
rithms, but with growing computational abilities these algorithms remain 
not adequate for ensuring a completely secure system. Hence this leads 
to a scenario where we understand, the necessity to rely upon newer and 
enhanced methods whose purpose is to achieve security concretely. To cater 
to these needs machine Learning algorithms are regarded as another set of 
solutions in the field of security. Recently, security systems are mainly 
hybrid systems where machine learning models are stacked alongside the 
Crypto algorithms. The cryptosystems have a straightforward function 
of encryption and the reversal of the function applied gives decrypted 
output. This characteristic of these algorithms makes them discrete in their 
way of operation, i.e., there is zero randomness in their working. Hence 
if the function is known, then input and corresponding outputs decoded 
are consistent. This consistent nature with no element of randomness or 
zero-probabilistic nature can pose a danger to the security of the system. 
We aim to make systems difficult to decode by introducing some level 
of randomness in systems meanwhile performance of the system is not 
affected. This is accomplished through algorithms of Machine Learning 
using which we train security systems built on pattern of data rather than 
only relying on a definite mathematical function. 
8.6 MACHINE LEARNING/DEEP LEARNING-BASED 
APPROACHES 
Machine Learning Models are generally developed for data processing. 
But usage of ML/DL algorithms for safety applications is considered 
as innovative approach that unites the subsequent domains: Machine 

 
163 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
Learning/Deep Learning and Data Security. As the computational capabili­
ties of computers increase, it becomes easy to resolve and find solutions to 
computationally hard problems, which are the foundation of cryptographic 
security algorithms. So, it is critical to discover newer methodologies, not 
dependent on mathematical functional operations but rather concentrating 
on the pattern in which data is stored rather than creating cipher texts to 
store rather try to learn the pattern of data to store it in different format 
and reconstruction of data is possible based on Training of model (learnt 
knowledge). So, in these kinds of approaches Machine Learning can aid 
as technology that protects our data. Some novel machine learning-based 
cloud security systems are conversed below. 
Mbarek et al. [19] proposed a model which strengthens cloud secu­
rity (for scenarios of Image Uploads) by segmenting the image in four 
different regions based on intensity levels by a hybrid model of SVM 
and FCM. Initially ,the images are taken and all pixels are classified in 
different regions by the SVM linear classifier but as the classifier is mainly 
intended for supervised learning, we association it with FCM that trains 
the SVM to progress performance of linear classifier. The FCM plays a 
main role in extracting the pixel level color features. These features are 
input vectors that are fed to SVM for classification purpose. Figure 8.3 
illustrates the overview of the proposed architecture of model proposing 
the segmentation model for images to be stored over the cloud. 
SVM classifies the pixels into different regions. The image is stored 
overcloud in its segmented format. This work was carried on healthcare 
industry images. The security here is enhanced because we focus on 
learning the pattern of data itself. After we learn the pattern of data, we 
are arranging data in improved (format different from original) manner 
over cloud. Hence this caters to issues of security and storage of cloud. 
The performance of machine learning models to contribute in the direction 
of security depends on the ability to learn patterns of data. Hence the key 
aspects while designing such systems is that type of data plays a fore­
most role. Generally, based on factors like nature and size of data, types 
of machine learning approaches are adopted. There are numerous data 
formats, but we aim to ensure its security irrespective of its format. Gener­
ally, the major formats in which data exists is either as images or plain text 
sequences. So, depending on the form of data selection approaches differ. 
It is observed if the format of data is textual sequence form, then the GA are 
good to learn them. Shalu et al. [20] established a methodology based on 

 
164 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
evolutionary algorithms to protect and improve cloud security levels. Data 
is first transformed to ASCII characters, after which it is turned to a block 
of bits. The data owner performs the conversion of ASCII characters into 
a block of bits (DO). To encrypt these blocks of bits and generate cipher 
blocks, we use genetic algorithms at random. To encrypt these blocks of 
bits, genetic algorithm processes such as cross overs and mutations are 
used. The pseudorandom number generator function determines the type 
of operations to be performed. Once these blocks have been encrypted, 
they are kept in various locations on the cloud, and the security of these 
cipher blocks is further enhanced by the DO supplied key. As a result, 
this system only has one key and the rest is dependent on GA. As a result, 
the performance of this framework is generally excellent. The decryption 
is based on dynamic links and reverses the GA-based processes, which 
are executed by transforming back to ASCII text. The GA works with 
random data chunks, which adds to security. We tried to compare different 
strategies in the next part based on security strength, integrity, execution 
speed, and other criteria, but each cryptographic strategy has its own set 
of strengths and drawbacks. Machine learning methods may be efficient 
to learn security pattern, but the ability and competence of the system can 
be increased using more complex techniques or by using complex model 
architectures inspired by Deep Learning techniques. However, a new tech­
nique to deep neural network training is to train them on encrypted data 
and learn the pattern of encrypted data rather than the original data. The 
main notion here is homomorphic encryption, which states that any action 
done on encrypted data produces a cipher text as a result. On decryption, 
this cipher is similar to plain text generated by doing the same operation on 
plain text, hence we can’t perform sophisticated computations or operations 
on cipher texts, as mathematically shown [21]. Ehsan et al. [22] created a 
model based on deep neural networks that were trained on encrypted data 
and then tested for classification tasks. By approximating the complex 
activation functions to their polynomial equivalent while maintaining the 
model’s performance accuracy, deep Neural networks were brought into 
the realm of homomorphic encryption. Crypto Nets fared worse than the 
suggested system. As a result, the suggested approach addresses the risk 
of using cloud platforms for analytics jobs. Using the previously indicated 
methodology, analytics may be done on cloud servers without compro­
mising data privacy because analytics are run on encrypted data. It is not 
necessary to have access to encrypted data in order to execute analytics.

8.7 ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON 
When we compare the various methods stated above, we can claim that 
asymmetric cryptographic algorithms are a little slower than symmetric 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
166 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
cryptographic algorithms, so ECC and RSA are slower than DES and AES, 
which are both symmetric. This is true because asymmetric algorithms use 
public and private keys that are larger in size. Similarly, because different 
keys are used in encryption and decryption, we may say that all asym­
metric cryptography approaches are more dependable. Taking storage 
capacity as a starting point, it is true that algorithms with longer keys 
require higher storage capacity. However, we can’t apply this comparison 
to all algorithms based on generic claims. As a result, the following is a 
full comparison among the all methodologists. 
The methods listed in Table 8.1 were implemented and their average 
encryption and decryption times were measured. This simulation simu­
lates the performance of DES, AES, RSA, and Blowfish implementations 
using built-in Cryptography modules/packages in Python 3 environments. 
This implementation is thoroughly tested and is optimized for maximum 
performance for the algorithm. The simulations are conducted with a 64-bit 
processor with 8 GB of RAM. The development environments used for simu­
lations are Anaconda Jupyter Notebooks and the Google Colab. Considering 
different sizes of data blocks (20 B to 400 B) the algorithms were evaluated 
in measure of performance. All the implementations were exact for relatively 
fair and accurate results. The outcomes recorded in Table 8.1.

A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
Table 8.1 shows the aggregate time for encryption and decryption for 
the methods proposed. The units of time are seconds. The conclusions 
depicted through the simulations are: ECC is most amicable when compu­
tational power, memories are limited. Moreover, as the size of the key 
increases in RSA, permutations of cracking the key also increases. Each 
technique has its individual importance depending upon the computational 
specifications provided. The overall simulation result interprets that as we 
increment the size of text, a larger key is desired for encryption. But this 
is computationally costly as the text size can keep growing invariable; 
hence the other encryption methods that have a unique approach like the 
hybrid cryptosystems or other masking methods like video steganography 
can serve in these situations. To increase security algorithm’s performance 
their complexity is upgraded, consequently increases time of encryption 
and decryption. Hence here we encounter the necessity for inventing a 
data security system not based on cryptographic algorithms purely. As the 
computational power of processors increase probability of finding solution 
of mathematical functions also increases. We try to understand the nature 
of algorithms to custom them efficiently. 
8.7.1 BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF DES 
The behavior of the algorithm is complicated, and it’s difficult to deci­
pher the mathematical rationale behind it since the Boxes go through a 
permutation-combination phase before moving on to the next round of 
creating cipher letters. In their research, Sombir et al. [23] demonstrated 
that DES outperforms RSA in terms of data encryption and decryption 
time. 
Due to the permutation combination phase, it’s possible that a given 
pattern of two inputs will produce the same output. As a result of the 
presence of the permutation and combination phases, there is a disparity 
between the system’s initial and end outputs. 
8.7.2 BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF RSA 
It entails calculating the integer factorization [24] of a larger number that 
is difficult to compute. Finding the integer factor is a time-consuming and 
laborious task. As a result, the size of keys should be larger in order to 

 
168 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
be more secure. Even if one of the keys is known, the other cannot be 
deciphered since they have a mathematical relationship. 
As computer processing power grows, so does the amount of data 
that can be processed. And concepts like parallel computing result in an 
exponential increase in calculation abilities, rendering RSA vulnerable to 
these breaches because intruders use the brute force method (to generate 
all the possible set of keys and test each key). To improve security, larger 
numbers are expected to be considered as a choice for the number whose 
factorization is conducted, i.e., larger keys are generated to overcome 
increasing computing powers, but maintaining larger keys is problematic 
because decryption is a lengthy procedure. 
8.7.3 BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF AES 
At both the hardware and software levels, it is simple to implement [25]. 
This standard is used by the majority of open-source solutions to protect 
data. To break security standards with 256 bits, around 2,256 attempts 
are required. Brute-force key breaking is computationally expensive and 
time-consuming. As a result, it might be considered a safe protocol. 
It makes it vulnerable to key scheduled attacks because it uses too 
simplistic mathematical logic, such as simple algebraic structures. As a 
result, we find that the algorithm’s straightforward mathematical formula­
tion is weak. As a result, it’s simple to break into and infiltrate a system 
secured by this algorithm. 
8.7.4 BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF ECC 
It runs extremely quickly because binary curves are well-suited to hard­
ware [26]. The significance of this technique is that it maintains security 
with smaller keys and that the encryption size is not fixed, i.e., smaller 
messages result in smaller encrypted communications. The size of the 
message is proportional to the encryption size. As a result, this algorithm 
is adept at efficiently utilizing bandwidth. 
Standard curves, in particular, make securing ECC difficult. When 
compared to Schnorr signatures, ECC Standards are mostly imitated. The 
key is tampered with since the signature is done with a faulty random 
number generator. This theory has some flaws, particularly when it comes 
to binary curves. 

 
 
 
 
169 
A Study on Data Security in Cloud Computing 
8.7.5 BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF BLOWFISH 
DES is slower than this. On small memory spaces, the technique works 
well [27]. The ability to change the size of the keys [28]. By increasing the 
number of rounds, you can develop your strength. 
Because each user has their own key, managing keys becomes more 
difficult as the number of users grows. The decryption method has a 
disadvantage over other algorithms in terms of execution time and serial 
throughput. 
8.8 THREAT TO CLOUD SECURITY: QUANTUM PERCEPTION 
Though Cryptography or machine learning may cater to the need of 
having secure communication, these do not ensure a permanent solution 
to cyber threats. With advancing technologies, the emergence of quantum 
computers would mean increasing the computational ability but simulta­
neously risking our encryption schemes. Most of encryption algorithms 
are adhered to by the complex mathematics which in practicality results 
in computationally costly process. But with quantum computers, these 
mathematical functions which are computationally challenging now, 
might seem solvable and programmable without being computation­
ally costly. Hence it means easy to crack keys of existing encryptions. 
Currently, quantum computers are not fully functional but possibilities of 
such technology emerging sooner into actual world is high. So, plans for 
implementing security schemes resistant to quantum powers are desired. 
To secure traditional cryptography from quantum powers there are two 
propositions: 
• Quantum cryptography; and 
• Post-quantum cryptography. 
8.8.1 QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY 
Quantum cryptography relies on different principles of quantum physics 
rather than only on mathematical formulations to ensure security. This 
cryptography is theoretically impenetrable. In quantum cryptography, 
key is shared via entangled-based protocol meaning key is transferred 

 
170 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
by quantum states which are in superposition state. This cryptography 
is stronger transcending traditional cryptography as it implements key 
transfer by being certain about third parties. If an attacker tries to inter­
vene then quantum states are no more in superposition state meaning the 
attacker cannot copy information or operate on copied state. 
The main application of quantum key transfer is communication over 
highly stretched distances using quantum properties. The popular proto­
cols of quantum key exchange are discussed in subsections. 
8.8.1.1 BB84 PROTOCOL 
In BB84, the secret key is encoded using the polarized states of the 
photon. This feature of encoding using photon energy makes the system 
secured as photon properties safeguard keys from attack. If polarization 
state of photon is measured then its consequences in destroying of photon 
completely making the attack difficult for eavesdropper. To penetrate 
system, eavesdropper is forced to send new photon, by default in wrong 
polarization state, leading to reveal of attack. 
 BB84 Application to Cloud Security: Yasser et al. proposed 
system which encrypts user data by using Enhancement BB84 
protocol generated key. Data is decodable by authenticated user 
who provides key over quantum channels. This method implemen­
tation resulted in system ensuring security for confidentiality of 
data. Observations reveal less encryption time increasing perfor­
mance and data transfer rates in cloud systems. This betterment of 
time period and performance is observed as the quantum protocols 
are secured and faster over the traditional Crypto methods. 
8.8.1.2 E91 PROTOCOL 
This protocol uses entangled state of photons to transmit information 
between two parties. Protocol mainly follows fundamental concept, the 
quantum states distributed between parties are correlated, meaning they are 
directionally synchronous, i.e., either vertically polarized or horizontally 
polarized. Attacker trying to intrude into this set up leads to destruction 
of correlation present between these quantum entangled states leading to 
reveal of attack to parties involved in communication.

 E91 Application to Cloud Security: This protocol is appropriate 
for cloud environments as they ensure high security. Li et al. [29] 
presented analysis about this protocol and observations revealed 
that when an eve (attacker) attempts to interfere, this interference 
can be detected by entitled parties involved in communication. 
Although Eavesdropper drops eve, he/she could access only up to 
50% of raw key data and is unaware about which part of the key 
does this 50% belongs to. For optimized performance of protocol 
is observed when noise levels are relatively low. 
From the perspective of hardware, for implementation of quantum 
cryptography, there are multiple challenges which make application of 
quantum cryptography difficult. To resolve hardware level limitations, the 
need arises to discover better techniques like Post-Quantum Cryptography 
which are practically implementable. 
8.8.2 POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY 
The aim of quantum cryptography is to strengthen traditional cryptography 
schemes rather replacing them. In quantum cryptography focal point is key 
transfer. Implementing this cryptography is relatively viable at hardware 
level compared to quantum cryptography as there is zero requirement of 
specialized quantum hardware. The fundamental basis this cryptography 
is mathematically hard problems, which are immune to identified quantum 
attacks, are utilized to encrypt data. There are three approaches proposed: 
• Lattice-based cryptography; 
• Error correcting cryptography; and 
• Multivariate polynomial-based cryptography. 
Among the three afore-mentioned approaches, Lattice-Based Cryptog­
raphy is maximum stable. Cloud ecosystems are expected to have agility 
and low latency, incorporation of these features through the traditional 
cryptosystems is impossible hence, Nejatollah et al. [30] proposed an 
accelerated system, proficient enough to run multiple cryptographic 
algorithms. This system was inspired from application-specific integration 
circuits (ASCI).

8.9 CONCLUSION 
In this chapter, numerous cryptographic methods for encrypting data 
were reviewed, as well as various types of ciphers that can increase cloud 
security, regardless of whether data is static or in transit. As new technolo­
gies emerge, newer ways to cloud security are embraced, as threats and 
breaches become impervious to previous tactics. As a result, cutting-edge 
machine learning-based implementations for cloud data security are also 
explored. A comparison is made between the algorithms, and the best 
technique for implementation is chosen depending on the needs of cloud 
systems. Currently, modern era is looking forward to the emergence of 
quantum computers and super computers. Reflecting on security in accor­
dance to their emergence posses’ threat to existing systems of security. To 
surpass this threat, strengthened version of traditional cryptography called 
quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography were proposed. 
In this survey, a brief understanding about quantum cryptography and 
quantum cryptography with supporting application to the field of cloud 
security. In this era of the data revolution, there is a great amount of data to 
manage and store, which draws consumers’ attention to cloud servers. As 
a result, maintaining the secrecy and security of cloud data is a critical part 
of ensuring the long-term viability of prospective cloud services.

West Bengal, India 
ABSTRACT 
The recruitment in the hospitality industry is one of the highest in the 
globe. Time has changed and the ‘soft expertise’ are overshadowing 
‘hard expertise.’ During the interview movement, employability exper­
tise outnumber technical expertise. Interviewer are relying more on 
Psychometric Exam to find the “ideal” applicant with multi-dimensional 
expertise. At this point, the roles played by universities and institutions 
are crucial. If a student is found to be “not employable,” they face the 
heat. This chapter aims to compare the perceptual difference the male 
and female undergraduate hospitality students on employability expertise 
taught at the institutions. A total of 205 students from eight West Bengal 
hospitality schools competed in the study. The information was gathered 
through an online questionnaire-answer mode distributed through a social 
media site. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 23. According to 
the findings, there is no substantial difference between male and female

hospitality students’ perceptions of the industry’s employability abilities 
and the level of feed they accept from their universities. 
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
The Hospitality Corporation or industry is among foremost global 
manpower recruiting industries. Time moves at a breakneck speed, and 
‘soft expertises’ are increasingly displacing ‘hard talents.’ During the job-
hiring process, employability expertise outnumber technical expertise. 
Interviewers are relying more on Psychometric Exams to find the “ideal” 
applicant with multi-modal expertise. At this point, the activities played by 
universities and colleges are crucial. Various studies looked at the perspec­
tives of various stakeholders on the nature of employability, including 
“companies” [1, 2]; “students” [1]; and “workers” [3]. In the 1980s, 
prominent research Fellows from the United Kingdom, the European 
countries nearly 1990s, and Australia around 2000 developed numerous 
employability systems. In those approaches, both talents of technical and/ 
or human characteristics were carried the same weightage. 
Employability was described by Hillage and Pollard [4] like “an apti­
tude to be employable, i.e.: (i) a capability to obtain first employment; 
(ii) capacity to keep job; and (iii) capability to earn new job if required.” 
Researchers have questioned the curriculum’s worth and value [5–9]. 
According to reports, the researchers have protested vehemently about the 
discrepancy they discovered between the institution’s course content and 
the industry’s requirements. 
9.2 REVIEW OF LITERATURE 
Wikramasinghe and Perera [10] conducted their research on computer 
science engineering entry-level graduate jobs in Sri Lanka. They reported 
that there is an influence of gender of graduates in employability expertise. 
Employability of an individual depends upon knowledge, expertise, and 
attitude; as used and deployed by an individual. The researchers stated about 
the difficulty in finding empirical studies that investigated and compared 
employability expertise of graduates, lecturers, and employers that they 
think to be valuable while applying for entry-level jobs. The researchers 
identified two aspects of employability expertise as: (i) subject expertise; 

 
Role of Hospitality Institutions in Development of Employability Expertise 
177 
and (ii) transferable expertise. The changes that have been witnessed in 
the employment pattern were influenced by employability expertise as 
transferable expertise. As advocated by the researchers, the primary idea 
of HEI (higher education institutions) is to impart knowledge, expertise, 
attitudes, and abilities to the students to empower them with lifelong 
employability. The employers, students, and lecturers have identified soft 
expertise like problem solving, self-confidence and teamwork as impor­
tant features. The graduates identified creative and innovative thinking 
as an important skill. The lecturers marked oral communication to be 
important. Universities using industry placement as a mode to address the 
employability expertise was also seen. As suggested, a graduate who has 
necessary expertise becomes motivated and efficient in the retention of 
employment by fulfilling their job task. 
Song et al. [11] conducted a study of entry-level individuals with and 
without disabilities. In the study, the most important five expertise by the 
professional graduates were Work Ethics, Team Work, Oral Communica­
tion, Social Responsibility, and Reading Comprehension. The study aimed 
to identify the employer’s expectation on the topic of research. A survey 
was conducted among 188 individuals where 168 participated in the study. 
A four-point Likert Scale was used to analyze the data. The purpose of this 
analysis was to do the comparison of average rating scores in each group. 
The highest level of skill seen in employees with disability was displaying 
of personal integrity/honesty in work, whereas the employees without 
disabilities rated “ability to read with understanding” as the most important 
skill. Amongst some noticeable differences in the employers “safety of 
employees” was given a higher rating for employees with disabilities than 
to those employees without disabilities. The female employers showed 
higher expectation than their male counterparts on their employees. They 
looked for better social expertise, work expertise and personal traits. 
However, the reason was unclear. 
Grashiela et al. [12] worked on the employer’s feedback on job perfor­
mance of the graduates through a descriptive type of research method. 
They focused on employability of computer engineering graduates in 
non-government higher education institution in the Philippines. The study 
aimed to determine the employability of computer engineering gradu­
ates in the Philippines by determining the employment status, nature of 
employment, competencies learned in college and work-related values. 
The most useful soft expertise as perceived by the graduates were: 

 
178 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
• Information technology expertise;” 
• “Communication expertise;” 
• “Problem solving expertise;” 
• “Critical thinking expertise;” 
• “Human relation expertise.” 
Industry partners have shown high regards for the graduates in terms of 
competencies like skill in research, work discipline, communication skill 
and computer skill. The students perceived entrepreneurial skill to be of 
least importance for the first employment similarly the employers found 
the same skill to be least present among the students. 
Oliveira and Guimarães [13] described the competency-based approach 
for curriculum development to improve the employability of the graduates 
as an outcome of Bologna Reform process at one university in Portugal. 
The universities in Portugal started encouraging the skill development of 
the students focusing on the employability from mid-1990’s like other 
universities in the European Union. A five-stage implementation strategy 
was designed for competency-based approach towards rearrangement of 
curriculum: 
 Stage 1: Market Value Expertise: The key expertise that is to be 
developed in the students so as to make them market ready through 
thorough need assessment of the employers. 
 Stage 2: Curricular Deconstruction: Focusing on the learning 
outcome the curriculum was discussed. 
 Stage 3: Curriculum Redesign: Structuring different subjects 
throughout three years addressing the transferrable expertise was 
done. 
 Stage 4: Mapping Transferrable Expertises: The transferrable 
expertise were identified in each subject, group of subjects and 
academic year. 
 Stage 5: Students’ Individual Coaching: The students were 
given special coaching on transferrable expertise where further 
development was necessary. 

 
 
Role of Hospitality Institutions in Development of Employability Expertise 
179 
Dimalibot et al. [14] expressed that the greater number of employees 
and entry-level graduates should possess knowledge and expertise in their 
respective fields to remain in competition. In research focusing on the 
employment status of tourism graduates in the Philippines, the researchers 
proposed an action plan for the enhancement of the curriculum and 
services offered at a university. The career planning in the area of tourism 
gives excellent rewards as this industry is the fastest growing industry 
in the world, creating a wide range of career options. The employment 
opportunities in the field require knowledge and expertise related to the 
field of specialization. As found, the expertise which are learned most in 
the college are communication expertise followed by human relation skill 
and critical thinking expertise. The work-related values which are valued 
most by the employers are professional integrity followed by perseverance 
and hard work and punctuality. 
Boyadjieva and Trichkova [15] aimed to study the relationship between 
the profile of HEI’s and graduate employability in Bulgaria. The economic 
globalization and knowledge economy has significantly influenced the 
perspective of graduates’ employability. The researchers found that the 
graduates passing out from private HEI’s are no way less employable 
than the graduates of public HEI’s but a notable difference was witnessed 
about the employability of graduates of different HEI’s studying same 
course. The researchers stated that the employability of the students is 
highly impacted by their institutional characteristics. The influence of 
quality academic staff has a huge impact on the employability measures 
as indicated in the result. The thinking of a student regarding the labor 
market, competition for jobs and employability is greatly controlled by the 
characteristics of the HEI’s. 
9.3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
9.3.1 OBJECTIVES 
The goal of this study was to see if there were any differences in percep­
tions of the relevance of employability expertise among male and female 
undergraduate hospitality students, as well as the “amount of input on 
employability expertise received at their respective colleges.”

9.3.2 DESIGN OF RESEARCH 
The Fellow or researcher adapted a quantitative data analysis method. 
The participants were selected from West Bengal’s undergraduate hotel 
management program. Students from eight West Bengal hospitality 
schools were involved in the study. Participants in the study were in their 
final year of hospitality institutions courses. 
9.3.3 SURVEY TOOL 
The questionnaire that was used for the collection of data was having two 
parts. The demographic background of the students was conceding the 
first part of the questionnaire. The second section of the survey focused 
on the employability expertise taught in undergraduate hospitality courses 
at the institutions. There were 34 employability expertises in the question­
naire. They were then separated into five skill sets: (i) basic academic 
expertises, (ii) interpersonal expertises, (iii) technical expertises (person­
ality), (iv) work-related expertises, and (v) social expertises. Traits value 
of employable abilities was rated using a 5-point Likert Scale with exceed­
ingly non-important (a), non-important (b), normal (c), important (d), and 
exceedingly important (e). 
9.3.4 VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY 
The researcher has used an instrument that has been adapted from the 
research article [16] that was published in IJRAR, Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 
161–166. 
9.3.5 HYPOTHESES 
Using the objectives and the research questionnaire as a guide, the 
researcher presented the following null hypotheses: 
 Hypothesis 1: When it comes to the institution’s input on Basic 
Academic Expertises, there is no discernible difference between 
male and female undergraduate hospitality students.

the institution’s Social Expertises contribution. 
 Hypothesis 6: In terms of the relevance of Basic Academic Exper­
tises, there is no discernible difference between male and female 
undergraduate hospitality students. 
 Hypothesis 7: When it comes to the value of personality traits, 
there is no variation in perception between male and female under­
graduate hospitality students. 
 Hypothesis 8: In terms of Work-Related Expertises, there is no 
discernible difference between male and female undergraduate 
hospitality students. 
 Hypothesis 9: When it comes to the importance of interpersonal 
expertise, there is no variation in perception between male and 
female undergraduate hospitality students. 
 Hypothesis 10: When it comes to the importance of social exper­
tise, there is no variation in perception between male and female 
undergraduate hospitality students.

Out of the 205 respondents 127 (62%) were male while 78 (38%) were 
female. All the students (100%) who have participated in the survey were 
learning in the last year of their academic process. 
• 
Hypothesis 1: H: There is no perceptual difference in the male 
and female undergraduate hospitality students regarding input by 
the institution on Basic Academic Expertise. 
The perceptual differences of male and female undergraduate hospitality 
students (N = 205) about amount of teaching input from the institution for 
basic academic expertise were compared using an independent–samples 
t-test, with the significant difference in mean of sampling data at the 0.05 
level. 
Based on the above result, no “statistically-significant difference” in 
the scores of Table 9.2 (basic academic expertise) about the perception of 
male students (M = 3.9, SD = 0.55) and female students (M = 3.8, SD = 
0.65) was found. Null hypothesis is accepted. 
• 
Hypothesis 2: H: There is no perceptual difference in the male 
and female undergraduate hospitality students regarding input by 
the institution on Personality Traits. 
The perceptual differences of male and female undergraduate hospi­
tality students (N = 205) about amount of teaching input from the institution 
related personality traits were compared using an independent–samples 
t-test, with the significant difference in mean of sampling data at the 0.05 
level. 
Based on the above result, no “statistically-significant difference” in 
the scores of Table 9.3 (personality traits) about the perception of male 
students (M = 4.3, SD = 0.57) and female students (M = 4.2, SD = 0.55) 
was found. Null hypothesis is accepted.

As the sample size (N = 205) was not big enough, the above outputs 
could not be generalized for the undergraduate hospitality student asso­
ciation in the whole state. The other reason was that due to connectivity 
constraints in the pandemic situation, the researcher could reach only eight 
hospitality institutions from the state. The background reason for this 
perception among the students may be investigated in the future during 
further research. A comparative study may be conducted among different 
institutions in a state or city in India. A study can be conducted among 
the public and the private institutions. Similar research studies may be 
conducted in the future where the data from different Indian states can be 
collected.

10.1 INTRODUCTION 
Internet of things (IoT) devices have in the development of opportunities 
and challenges and also additional important responsibilities, and on that 
condition those essential services such as venture companies, management 
departments, healthcare sectors and all public sectors [1–5]. Healthcare 
services have been aggressively using the IoT to betterment of the quality 
of patients’ treatment, physicians, caretakers, and medical suppliers, all of 
which are dependent on application conditions. It is a very smart device 
that facilitates to the machine-machine and/or machine-human with 
an interfacing achievable organization system. An IoT system has been 
launched opportunities and challenges [6–10] such as gaming, finance, 
transportation, and healthcare [11–18]. IoT system has a global system 
that joins the device to the internet or Wi-Fi communications to each other 
using Wi-Fi sensors systems [19]. In this system, increasing technology 
has rapidly established that 60 billion gadgets will be ported to the globe 
by 2025. Several Smart applications will be developed in our systems, 
allowing us to be smarter, better, more effective, and more efficient while 
reducing unnecessary costs. In our innovation, the action in the health 
monitoring arrangement is one of the tough challenging due to the safety 
measures problems of data that know how to can be measured and also 
repeatedly improving and developing an innovative ideas or smart solu­
tions to be find out to be updated the patients details and all the things. In 
this system, present a multiplicity of claim, and its benefits are observed 
to be extremely truthful and speedy recovery.

Transportation, agriculture, healthcare, etc. Name of any fields and their 
applications under improvement of global innovations. 
In our systems is a most vital part role of our life in all developed 
countries. Sadly, the steadily getting old population and the related rise 
in unending illnesses is placing significant nervous tension on modern 
healthcare systems, and the demand for resources from transports hospital 
beds to doctors and nurses are extremely high facilities without doctors’ 
situations (like COVID-19). The IoT has been generally qualified as 
a possible solution to improve the demands on the healthcare systems 
in looks at monitoring patients with specific exclusively taking the all-
diseases circumstances like patient’s problems to be determined [35–37]. 
There are a demand and people are looking for young talent that knows 
this integration of sensors, embedded systems, and communication devices 
and their protocols. Computer science topics, especially data aggregation, 
data analysis, and the subsequent development of algorithms for decision 
making, are in high demand. 
• The application layer is made up of wearable devices that can 
collect biomedical data such as moisture, temperature, pulse, brain, 
or heart electrical waves. 
• The network layer stands on edge computing services such as data 
storage, signal processing, anonymization, and analysis in the 
cloud. 
• The perception layer is dependent on the friendliness of the user. 
All communication is through Bluetooth, Zigbee or Wi-Fi and also 
sensors [19–26]. 
Non-invasive devices such as monitoring blood pressure, blood sugar 
and SpO2 healthcare devices at very low cost, wearable devices, real-time 
patient monitoring system within medical alert systems. Patients’ body 
monitors the blood pressure, SpO2 and blood glucose level measured after 
feedback sends the doctor’s phone.

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
In the global conditions systems are to be costlier depends upon the 
technology development, because of the increasing level of the popula­
tion automatically at old aging people and (serpis) chronic disease 
also increasing in the developed countries. In all the country would go 
to supportive due to people would be more exaggerated in the chronic 
diseases [35–37]. 
10.2 INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) APPLICATIONS 
In recent years, extensive study has been undertaken on the advantages of 
cloud computing for healthcare applications [7, 18, 28, 31] as shown in 
Figure 10.1.

quality of soil using road preparation and its constructions conditions, 
after GPS system using traffic jams on the road and its direction all things, 
and a that occur during functions, festivals, and other irregular problems 
are to be monitored. 
10.2.3 AGRICULTURE 
In this, monitor the prominence of our surroundings by analyzing plant 
sand and land procurement for harvesting or cropping to be maintained 
the raw seeds to final cropping monitored by the monsoon and atmosphere 
conditions and weather reports and all surroundings with the major help 
of sensors. 
10.2.4 INSIDE HOUSES 
This system can be observed and manage all electrical and mechanical and 
also communications devices like internet, television, smartphones and 
also save the water usage utilizing and electrical usage is possible control 
through by the systems. 
10.2.5 HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS 
In this system are suitable for popular rising innovations are fast develop­
ments for old aging persons, chronic illness patients not recovered, new 
medicines, and inventive wearable devices are continuously changing 
human service without disturbing the patient’s feasibility. Technology will 
not be able to prevent the world’s population from aging or developing 
chronic diseases. But some research developments also can’t stop the area 
it is also going on progress improvements again and again. 
10.2.6 PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION IN HEALTHCARE 
In today’s global humanity citizens are under a bundle of pressure to work 
nature and hard work pain in their jobs while also managing their families, 
the financial system, and the environment situations after end of his retired 
services are effected by chronic illness problems look like aged and or

medicines or not adopted in the new technology to be occurred. Nowadays, 
the recent researchers are highly developed in day by day andand improve 
their healthcare technologies using smart techniques using in their system 
at high-speed internet communications in all essential fields. However, 
the success of IoT systems in our purpose for only remote area moni­
toring such as home, patients, physicians, hospitals, and wearable devices 
requiring short-range and long-range communications will be critical. In 
our systems, impartment building blocks are constructing an intellectual 
infrastructure to serve, manage, and support the devices that are increasing 
the world’s population and save the time and save the life cycle. 
The expanding performance of healthcare systems, as well as the 
appearance of big data in healthcare, are driving IoT support, advanced 
technology in an improved the wearing of the devices and Wi-Fi connec­
tivity or Bluetooth, and growing infiltration of simultaneous devices in 
healthcare equipment. As a product, in the future scope of smart cities 
will be required smart hospitals in the future that can enable remote 
control of the flow of patients, provide critical situation, patient one-time 
access, actions, and analyze data to use the best approach for research 
or existing patents records are updated regularly. They will be improving 
their patients’ outcomes and eminence or save the life for patients and also 
update the human data and medicines stored [41–45].

204 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
on IoT technology, such as the emergence of precise sensors with low 
performance structures is critical in this system. Mainly focused on the 
sensors are that non-obtrusive and non-invasive types of sensors such as 
implantable. Considered they are five fundamental sensors are used in the 
system. First three for monitoring the vital signs of beat, respiratory speed, 
and body heat, and a further two for monitoring blood pressure and blood 
oxygen, both commonly recorded in hospital environments [19–26]. 
10.8.1 PULSE SENSOR 
It is an Arduino-based sensor to measure heart pulse rate. 
10.8.2 RESPIRATORY RATE SENSORS 
Respiratory rate sensors may be the most commonly used to read the pulse 
and is a vital indicator that can be used to detect a variety of emergency 
situations, including cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and vasovagal 
syncope. Pulse sensors have been extensively studied for medical and

10.8.6 OTHER WEARABLE SENSORS FOR HEALTHCARE 
The sensors that developed several critical special health parameters are 
like heart health in wearable sensors that may be useful in the healthcare 
systems focused on monitoring a specific condition such as echo-cardio 
grams (ECG). To collect these signals, wearable sensors have been 
designed. Based on our research into the most cutting-edge technology in 
the field of wearable sensors. 
• Focusing on healthcare monitoring system in the big data. 
• Interactive health-based smart phone used to review apps. 
10.9 HEALTHCARE IN COMMUNICATIONS 
Communications are related to the IoT for healthcare can be classified into 
two main categories: 
i. 
Short-range communications; and 
ii. Long-range communications. 
The previous communication used between devices within the WBAN, 
whilst the latter provides a connection between the central node of the 
WBAN and a base station. Both sorts of communications are regarded 
equally important in this chapter. 
10.9.1 SHORT-RANGE COMMUNICATIONS 
Short-range communications are used repeatedly between sensor nodes and 
the central node where data processing occurs in this wearable healthcare 
system, which can also be other goals, such as establishing mesh networks 
for smart lighting, could be pursued. Many short-range communications 
standards exist, but Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and Zigbee are likely to 
be the most widely utilized in IoT systems. 
10.9.2 LONG-RANGE COMMUNICATIONS 
In the urban context, long-range communications protocols with high 
applicability for IoT applications employed Low-Power Wide-Area 
Networks (LPWANs) with a range of several kilometers. This is far greater 

 
206 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
than the range of traditional IoT connectivity like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. This 
device design permits for low-power, whose ranges are on the order of 
meters, making healthcare practicable would necessitate significant and 
pricey mesh networking or comparable. This decreases the chance of 
patients going offline and gives the wearer additional convenience. The 
most outstanding justification for broadcasting data from the central node 
to the Cloud storage is based on these advantages. 
10.9.3 BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY (BLE) 
Low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) The special interest group (SIG) created 
Bluetooth to provide energy-efficient wearable gadgets which consist of 
a coin-cell battery-operated devices such as smartphones. It also connects 
with small peripheral and processing devices that enable IoT which is suit-
able for healthcare applications. 
10.9.4 ZIGBEE 
It was created by the Zigbee Alliance Company with the sole purpose of 
creating low-cost, low-power M2M networks based interconnections. 
Dissimilar types of modules supply and different characteristics based on 
the physical standard IEEE 802.15.4. 
10.9.5 WI-FI 
The Wi-Fi signals are taken out from advantageous off-the-shelf smart-
phones and laptops. Initial achievement of Wi-Fi-based human being 
activity sensing but to utilize the signals to automatically recognize the 
user’s diet moments, some challenges require to be determined such as 
data-rate, band, specification, coverage, nodes, mechanism, protection, 
battery, and also cost of the systems. Comparison of short-range commu-
nication standards Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Wi-Fi and their comparison is 
already reported [26]. 
Overall, healthcare systems in Zigbee are almost compatible with 
numerous security mechanisms range, data rate, and power consumption 
for certain applications, and discovered that low-power, high-data-rate 

 
207 
Application of IoT and Big Data in Automated Healthcare 
modules with an acceptable range were also available. The key disad-
vantages of Zigbee communications are that explanation might substitute 
cooperation unless the manufacturer implements it exceptionally well 
such as Medtronic PLC, Koninklijke Philips.

home, such as 24×7 access to watches remotely. 
4. Mobility: supporting is advance in healthcare systems and solu-
tions such as a patient bed that converts into a wheelchair or 
depends upon the needs used in the reconfigurable mechanism or 
robot. 
5. Informatics: It is processing and planning the schedule for profes-
sionals like physician, such as a smart mobile phone that always 
keeps updating the health information from the patient to hospital 
or physician or caretaker. 
10.12 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this system is a unique and innovative characteristic of the IoT, a lot of 
challenges need to be overcome to preserve scalable, individual, protected, 
and reliable operations for all manufacturing industries and medical in this 
chapter. In this system with IoT identified the problem with importance on 
the significance concepts involved, implementations applications struc-
tural, monitoring, and big data challenges. 
Mostly all things are equipped with sensors with actuators entering

10.13 CONCLUSION 
Modern research utilizes new cloud technologies applied for data storage 
and the most excellent performance for collecting and organizing big data 
in healthcare systems. In particular, we reviewed the investigations into 
the most advanced model of IoT-based healthcare systems in fields such 
as wearable sensors, interactions data standards, and cloud data storage 
methods, which can be applied to challenging tasks and monitoring the 
patients and physician-specific conditions and hospital observing, as well 
as all feedback. 
These challenges consist of patient care superiority and safety, 
dramatically growing hardware costs and limitations, healthcare expenses, 
advanced computing speeds. Short and the suitability of long-range 
communications for advanced healthcare was then compared with systems

ABSTRACT 
The manuscript deals with forecasting COVID-19 analysis based on 
collected data and corresponding analysis. The heterogeneity of data is 
maintained by considering several classes for input parameters, along 
with consideration of the post-lockdown period. Through case studies, 
the impact of Covid on other diseases is investigated, along with job 
status, online teaching-learning, etc. The effect of 2nd wave is elaborately 
discussed in a separate section, which helps to investigate the impact of 
Covid 19 in detail. The data analysis and data forecasting make it abun­
dantly evident that COVID-19 is becoming less widespread every day 
while the likelihood of obtaining the vaccination is gradually rising. One 
of the biggest issues is the population. In addition, the use of technology, 
IT, and online teaching and learning is quickly expanding in the modern 
world.

System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
11.1 INTRODUCTION 
COVID-19 is a coronavirus infection produced by a family of corona-
viruses that causes illnesses such as the common cold. Beginning in the 
year 2019, it is producing Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS) and 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [1] by altering its variations 
and showing a wide range of symptoms. It has said to be initially origi­
nated in China in and around November 2019 with the onset of the first 
case in the market of Wuhan. The World Health Organization declared 
it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 
2020, and subsequently declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [2], 
as the disease’s emission was accumulating at an unfathomable rate and 
causing millions of deaths throughout the world. On May 22, 2020, 166 
million cases had been verified over the world, with 3.4 million fatalities. 
The virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) 
is a member of the coronavirus family, which includes viruses found in 
bats and pangolins [2]. The virus can be detected by taking a swab from 
the nose and throat under medical circumstances and detecting whether 
or not the virus is present. Coming in contact with an infected person 
can cause the other person to contaminate the disease. When a COVID 
infected person sneezes, coughs, talks, or shares food, the worst virus may 
be spread fast and easily from one person to another. The infected person’s 
droplets do not hover in the air but rather recline on the ground since they 
are too heavy to float in the air. These droplets can enter the body when a 
person inhales, touches any surface which consists of the virus, and touch 
the face or eyes. Here, two works are done simultaneously, one is the data 
analysis part of the dangerous biological weapon Coronavirus and on the 
other hand, the next part is the impact of COVID-19 are discussed and 
the scenario is forecasted using the exponential algorithm [14], where it is 
very clear that the condition will be changed in no time. But for that the 
need for vaccination is very important, this is the challenge nowadays. 
11.2 STATUS OF COVID-19: DATA ANALYSIS 
According to recent findings, it primarily affects people within a 6-foot 
radius of each other [2]. During the early days of the disease, it was 
unknown to the doctors and scientists how it was spreading. Figure 11.1 

 
 
219 
Forecasting the Impact of COVID-19: Data Analysis 
shows the data for COVID-19 spread from February to May 2020. Figures 
11.2 (according to the research of 2020) and 11.3 (for children) show the 
symptoms at a glance [11]. 
FIGURE 11.1 COVID-19 spread from February to May 2020. 
Fever, cough, loss of taste and smell, tiredness, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, muscle pains throughout the body, chills, sore throat 
and runny nose, headaches, chest pain (mild-severe), conjunctivitis (rare), 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes are the symptoms of the virus that 
individuals should. 
The range of its contamination can be calculated from mild to severe, 
showing different symptoms as per individuals. Some might show all the 
above-mentioned symptoms whereas others might show few of them. 
Some people were asymptomatic but were able to contaminate the other 
person if the other person touches the contaminated surfaces and touched 
his eyes, nose, or face making him COVID positive. The asymptomatic 
person may not be at higher risk but by transmitting the disease to others 
who might be suffering from an autoimmune disease or might be a patient 
of cancer, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, pregnancy, etc. These patients 
are always at high risk than the others. Complications among such patients 

 
 
220 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
may lead to clotting of blood, pneumonia, organ failure, dysfunctional 
kidneys, etc. 
FIGURE 11.2 Symptoms (according to the research of 2020) with percentage. 
The only way to stop the spread is to take preventative steps like 
sanitization and wearing masks. People, institutions, society, and local 
and national governments have documented measures such as separating 
from the public at home and outdoors, sanitizing, and wearing a mask in 
public. To track the spread of the disease and take appropriate precautions, 
measures such as detecting symptoms and isolating individuals, tracing 
infected people and quarantining them, social and physical distancing 
measures such as mass gatherings, international and national travel 
measures, and vaccines and treatments [3] were calculated.

11.3 LOCKDOWN AND UNLOCK 
The measure of Social and physical distancing helped to slow the spread of 
disease by stopping chains of transmission of COVID-19 and preventing 
new ones from transmitting. Lockdown was announced in some parts of 
the world to slow the transmission level to the greatest extend. Sanitizing 
roads and restaurants so that the contaminated areas can be cleaned, fami­
lies were asked to isolate themselves from each other to stop the chain 
from increasing. Avoiding over-crowding, visits to malls, and shopping 
were among some of the measures taken. Work from home and telecon­
ferencing, e-commerce, and e-learning were made compulsory as all the 
offices, schools, and public places were shut for a few months. The rise 
in cases all over the world forced people to follow the rules and regula­
tions. Awareness regarding the spread of COVID-19 spread throughout 
the world spreading words of masking themselves while in public, cough 
etiquette and social distancing became a norm in normal. 

 
 
 
222 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
During the outbreak of the disease, the ultimate solution, according to 
the Government was an announced lockdown for 21 days. So, the Central 
Government announced a lockdown for 21 days on 22nd March 2020 to 
check the transmission and further steps would be taken by the situation. 
Figure 11.4 shows the lockdown dates with days. 
FIGURE 11.4 Lockdown dates with days. 
It would have been easier to contain the pandemic if India had not been 
the world’s second most populous country. Individual mobility restrictions 
were introduced as soon as people began to be more optimistic and social 
separation became the norm. As of April 7, 2020, around 5,000 confirmed 
cases had been recorded in India, with 90% of patients being healed. 
Before the epidemic engulfed the globe, the rate of mortality is 03% [8]. 
The Government had come up with different strategies for helping the 
poor and needy in this situation. Due to the lockdown and upturned situ­
ation of the economy, the struggle of the majority of the citizens was in 
a thrash which was somehow taken care of by the Government and also 
a lot of NGOs which took part in controlling the situation. After that few 
restrictions were waved, and these phases are called unlock, Figure 11.5 
shows the dates along with the days of the phases.

FIGURE 11.5 Unlock phase. 
Around October, there was a sharp drop in the COVID cases and it 
was a sigh of relief for the Indians and brought a new ray of hope among 
Indians. There were trials of vaccine tests but was no confirmation of 
vaccines were to be effective. 
11.4 CASE STUDY 
According to the Clinical Management Protocol for the New Coronavirus, 
which was issued by the Brazilian National Ministry of Health in February 
this year, males and people over the age of 50 predominated among the first 
99 patients brought to a hospital in Wuhan with pneumonia and a confirmed 
diagnosis of COVID-19. The analysis is depicted in Figure 11.6. Lympho­
penia was detected in a separate study including 41 people who had been 
diagnosed with COVID-19. Guan et al. [4] looked at studied data from 
1,099 patients in China who had confirmed COVID-19 and found Guan 
et al. [4] analyzed data from 1,099 patients in China who had confirmed 
COVID-19 and discovered that the average age of the patients was 47 
years old, with 41.9% of the patients being female. In 67 individuals, the 
predominant combined consequence was admission to the intensive care 
unit (ICU), the need for mechanical breathing, or death (6.1%). 

 
 
 
224 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
The average incubation time was four days. The majority of patients did 
not have a temperature and had normal X-ray results. Based on a survey of 
55,924 verified cases, the World Health Organization-China Joint Mission 
on Coronavirus Disease 2019 [3] reported the most common signs and 
symptoms: fever, fatigue, and vomiting [4]. About 80% of individuals with 
COVID-19 who had it verified in the lab had mild to severe symptoms, 
which comprised both pneumonia and non-pneumonia instances. Dyspnea, 
a respiratory rate of less than 30 breaths per minute, a peripheral oxygen 
saturation level of less than 93%, and an arterial oxygen tension/fraction 
of oxygen ratio of less than 300 were all symptoms indicating severe 
sickness in 13.8% of the participants. In the first 24 to 48 hours, 6.1% 
experienced a severe disease, which included respiratory catastrophe and 
septic jolt, with or without multiple organ dysfunction/failure; Although 
asymptomatic infection has been documented, the percentage of people 
who are asymptomatic is unclear.

such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory

disease, and cancer, are stated to be the people most at risk of serious 
illness and death [4]. 
After becoming infected with the virus, the incubation period ranges 
from 2 to 14 days. Symptoms of the virus included a dry cough, fever, 
and/or loss of smell and taste, as well as a painful throat that ranged from 
mild to severe. It was suggested that anyone who had direct touch with 
someone who tested positive with the virus separate themselves from 
others, particularly the elderly. Even if a patient’s test results are positive, 
he or she does not need to be admitted to the hospital; instead, patients 
can recuperate at home with the help of recommended medication and a 
well-balanced diet. 
11.5 COVID-19 IN INDIA 
While the world has counted 16.6 crores [5] (only medically tested till 
23.05.2021) of tested coronavirus patients, India has tested 2.3 Crores 
(as tested as and on 23/04/2021) positive cases of coronavirus. On 
January 27, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 infection was reported 
in Kerala. A 20-year-old returnee from Wuhan, China, and a student at 
Wuhan University went to the hospital on January 23rd for a test and 
remained asymptomatic until January 26th, when she complained of a 
dry cough and sore throat the next morning. On the 27th of January, she 
awakened with a little sore throat and a dry, persistent cough. According 
to the girl, there was no history of interaction with a person who was 
suspected or confirmed to have a COVID-19 illness. She went on to 
say that though she had not visited the Wuhan wholesale market, she 
had come into contact with persons who were exhibiting symptoms. As 
soon as she returned from Wuhan, China, she received instructions from 
the Kerala State Authorities and Government to quarantine herself and 
monitor her symptoms [6]. She was kept under continual surveillance 
for days, including swab testing, oxygen level measurements, and body 
temperature checks. Her sample was collected for 14 days in a row, 
and the results were positive; On the 17th day, the negative result was 
confirmed. It was unclear how long it took the body to produce anti­
body, and positive instances of the virus began spreading more quickly 
in India. 
The Indian government decided to vacate over 250 Indians from 
Wuhan, China where the pandemic has killed many lives. The Union 

 
 
226 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
health ministry had taken steps to request the returnees of China to isolate 
themselves and self-report themselves in case of any COVID-19 symp­
toms so that immediate action can be taken for them and the chain of 
spread can be stopped [7]. 
On 22nd February the Government imposed restrictions on movements 
and the region was divided into two – red zones and yellow zones. Red 
zones included areas like Lombardy and Veneto, and outside of these 
regions were marked as yellow zones. Schools and municipalities in and 
around this area were closed. All the educational trips were canceled and 
people were asked to buy supplies for at least 14 days [10]. 
All the community services, matches as well as pre-dated Carnivals 
were canceled or postponed for few days but later canceled by Prime 
Minister Giuseppe Conte. To halt the virus’s spread, health officials estab­
lished emergency phone lines for people to contact if they develop signs of 
the illness. The sessions in court were postponed for a few days [10]. Till 
date the scenario is as follows: Total cases 2.72 Cr + 2.09 L, Recovered 
2.44 Cr + 2.96 L, Deaths 3.11 L + 4,157. 
11.6 THE SECOND WAVE 
Though the year 2021 bought a new ray of hope in the form of vaccine, 
there was no confirmation of when it was supposed to be applied. In March 
2021, there was a certain outbreak of COVID-19, the second wave which 
came up with different symptoms and mild and severe ones. Though the 
testing game had improved from the first wave of COVID-19 the increased 
cases of COVID-19 could not be controlled in this phase and approxi­
mately 5,000 deaths (approx.) were reported on May 19th, 2021. The new 
wave came up with a mutated version of corona spreading quicker than 
before and cumulating the number of cases too. 
New developed symptoms include instant saturation of oxygen level 
without any other symptoms of the earlier virus affecting ages between 18 
and 60 years of age. And like before, the more prone to the severity of the 
cases is of the patients who have other auto-immune diseases, diabetes, 
asthma patient, cancer, etc. With the death toll rising above normal the 
Government couldn’t handle the scenario, Maharashtra had seen the worst 
phase of the second wave cases. Figure 11.7 shows the affected in the 1st 
and 2nd wave.

Forecasting the Impact of COVID-19: Data Analysis 
FIGURE 11.7 Affected in 1st and 2nd wave. 
With an increase in the number of instances, people’s need for vaccina­
tions has grown as well, resulting in a vaccine supply shortage. Given 
India’s population, widespread production of the vaccine is critical. Many 
people lost their employment as a result of the epidemic, as seen in Figure 
11.8. Many jobholders lost their jobs due to this pandemic; Figure 11.8 
shows the data.

11.7 IN OTHER COUNTRY 
The first woman to be tested positive in South Korea was a Chinese 
woman of 30 years of age on 20th January 2022 and later, a 55-year-old 
man was confirmed as the second case of COVID-19 who worked at 
Wuhan and returned to South Korea. Till 17th February 2020 around 30 
cases of COVID-19 cases were found in South Korea [9]. South Korea 
noted 79.4% of coronavirus cases were confirmed. Cases rising and drop­
ping in April till September, October saw a drop in the number of cases 
with 100 cases per day [9]. 
The month of September also witnessed a slight drop in new cases 
so they uplifted the restrictions on few places like restaurants would 
open keeping new restrictions in mind, after school activities to restart, 
also gyms and bars to reopen keeping in mind the restrictions on social 
distancing, masking, sanitizing, etc., but as November arrived there was 
again a surge in the cases closing all gyms and bars. December reports the 
onset of the third wave of virus which was bought about by a family of 
three who returned from the United Kingdom to South Korea. 
On 10 February 2021, South Korea declared its first approval of a 
COVID-19 vaccine to Oxford–AstraZeneca knocking a warning for the 
senior citizens due to limited intervention [9]. But that was not the ulti­
matum for South Korea as they saw a flood of the fourth wave in March. 
South Korea, like any other country has suffered economically, but 
they have allowed the small firm business to run at its own pace. Schools 
and colleges are continuing with internet learning. And restrictions on 
movements have been removed but norms of social distancing, wearing 
masks in public remains constant. 
The first two positive cases in Italy were evidenced in the body of two 
Chinese tourists in Rome who have traveled from China on 31st January 
2020 [10]. By the end of March, there was a cluster of cases all over Italy. 
Italy reported 3,83,854 active cases as of 9th May 2020, one of the highest 
COVID cases in the world. According to the Italian National Institute of 
Statistics (ISTAT), Italy has a mortality rate of 2,036 deaths per million. 
According to ISTAT, the mortality rate will increase by 1,00,526 fatalities 
in 2020, compared to the previous five years [10]. 
One of the major effects of COVID-19 is going digital, online classes, 
online jobs, work from home. So, the new technologies are there in Figure 
11.9. 

 
 
 
 
 
229 
Forecasting the Impact of COVID-19: Data Analysis 
On 4th March 2020, the region was closed down for a few weeks after 
the country reached 100 deaths in a day. On 24th March there was an exten­
sion of lockdown putting more constraints on movement and gatherings 
till 13th April. There was an announcement of schools and colleges being 
shut down till September. 
In and around June there was leniency on the lockdown letting people 
freely move in the region. Though several charges will be applied if rules 
of social distancing, masks were not maintained. 
FIGURE 11.9 Popular online platforms. 
11.8 EXPONENTIAL FORECASTING 
The model equation is as follow: 
z t( ) = χ( )t +φ( )t 
(11.1) 
where; z(t) is a random variable that describes the effect of stochastic 
fluctuation and takes a constant at time t and may change slowly over 
time; is a random variable that takes a constant at time t and may change 
slowly over time; (t) is a random variable that takes a constant at time t and 
may change slowly over time. 
The core notion of an exponential smoothing model is that it will learn 
a bit from the most recent demand observation and remember a bit from 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the last prediction it did at each period. The model’s most recent forecast 
includes both a component of the previous demand observation and a 
component of the prior projection. Based on historical demand, this past 
projection contains all the model has learnt thus far. The learning rate, 
alpha, determines the significance of the most recent demand observation. 
Let’s take a mathematical look at it [12, 13].

Alpha, which is a ratio, measures the relevance of the most current 
observation in contrast to the relevance of demand history. 
Alpha dt–1 is the previous demand observation multiplied by the 
learning rate. You may argue that the model lends considerable weight to 
the most recent demand incidence (alpha). 
The amount of information recalled by the model from its previous 
forecast is (1-alpha) ft–1. Because ft–1 was defined as partially dt–2 and 
ft–2, the recursive magic occurs here. There is a natural trade-off to be 
made here between learning and remembering, between being reactive 
and being steady. 
Once we’ve departed the historical era, we need to construct a predic-
tion for future periods. It’s simple: the most recent projection is simply 
projected ahead. If we define ft 
* as the most recent projection based on 
past demand.

Nonetheless, the surgery is strongly advised. However, there are several 
limitations: 
• It offers no predictions regarding what will happen in the future. 
Our second model, exponential averaging with trend, also known 
as the double multiple regression, will handle this issue. 
• It is unaffected by seasonal changes. The triple exponential 
smoothing strategy will be used to overcome this issue. 
• It would be unable to use any data sources.

The European EMA approved the Moderna vaccine on January 6, 
2021, and millions of individuals have already got it as of May 3rd. 
Nature’s most dangerous gift is the COVID-19, in the 1st wave it has 
come with the Amphan cyclone, and in the 2nd wave, it comes with the 
Yash cyclone. Where it is said that the main point is to stay home, but 
these cyclones destroyed many houses and many of the people are out of 
home, for shelter they have to stay in a place where to maintain the social 
distance is itself a challenge. Figure 11.16 shows the vaccination status 
in India and worldwide for the last 90 days. As per the latest update, only 
11.2% of people got their 1st vaccine and only 3.1% of people got the 2nd  
dose of vaccination in India.

It is very clear from the data analysis and data forecasting that, the spread 
of COVID19 is decreasing day by day and the chance of getting the 
vaccine is also increased but slowly. The population is one of the major

CHAPTER 12 
Comparative Analysis of SVM and KNN

ABSTRACT 
Cases of cancer in various forms, especially breast cancer among women, 
have been on the rise in recent times. If we are able to correctly categorize 
patients having malignant or benign form of breast cancer on the basis 
of historical data, it would not only eliminate human errors that often get 
introduced in proper identification of diseases but would also go a long 
way in providing correct diagnosis and ensure speedy recovery. Although 
there are a number of classification algorithms available to carry out this 
task on a given dataset, this chapter focuses on support vector machine 
(SVM) classifier and K-nearest neighbor classifier. Both techniques are 
applied on given data and results are recorded. This is followed by a 
comparative analysis of both the algorithms in achieving the task at hand 
using appropriate parameters. The chapter concludes with an overview of 
suggestions on how to obtain better classification results and the scope of 
reliance on data to arrive at concrete results for the diagnosis of patients 
suffering from critical ailments. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) 
Data Set is used for experimentation purposes.

12.1 INTRODUCTION 
The menace of cancer has engulfed the lives of millions around the world. 
It is a disease which oftentimes does not exhibit any initial symptoms but 
reveals its deadliness at a time when there is little left to be done. Had there 
been a reliable way to detect cancer at an early stage, saving the lives of 
people would have been a lot easier. This manuscript takes a step forward 
in that very direction by trying to test and compare the performance of two 
popularly used machine learning models – K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and 
support vector machine (SVM) in trying to classify tumors as benign or 
malignant using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set [1]. Breast cancer is 
particularly common among women but it has been found to be curable [2] 
in approximately 70% to 80% of patients provided there is early detection. 
According to Ref. [2], India is particularly seeing a rising number of cases 
of breast cancer among younger women below the age of 40. The trend 
becomes even more disturbing when it is compared to data 25 years ago. 
The cancer detection problem is one which requires immediate attention. 
According to Ref. [3], the number of new cases in males and females will 
rise to 0.934 million and 0.935 million respectively by 2026. The study [3] 
also goes on to state that 50% to 60% of total patients will be diagnosed with 
either tobacco-related cancer, breast cancer or cervical cancer. Keeping the 
grim statistics aside, accurate prognosis based on historical data can go a 
long way in understanding the symptoms that may lead to cancer at a later 
stage in a person’s life and thereby preventing the onset of the disease. 
12.2 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Given historical data of patients, the task is to classify an unknown data 
point expressed as a set of values of various features of a digital image of 
cell nuclei as either malignant tumor or benign tumor. Since class labels 
are available for training the models, this is a case of supervised learning. 
As class labels are categorical (Malignant and Benign), it is a binary clas­
sification problem. 
12.2.1 K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN) 
The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm [4] is an instance-based 
learning algorithm where data is merely stored during the training phase 
but not used to build a model. In the testing phase, all the data is used for 

 
239 
Comparative Analysis of SVM and KNN in Breast Cancer Classification 
classifying an unknown point. The ‘K’ refers to the number of neighbors 
which participate in the decision-making process of classification. There 
are mainly three steps to the algorithm: 
 Step 1: Calculating the distance from the unknown point, P, to all 
points in the dataset. 
 Step 2: Choosing ‘K’ points which have minimum distance. 
 Step 3: Classifying P based on majority vote. 
The main challenge lies in choosing the value of ‘K.’ There is no fixed 
method based on which ‘K’ can be chosen. It largely depends on the data 
set being worked on. Oftentimes, various values of ‘K’ are tried out. The 
value which gives the best performance is chosen. A rule of thumb is to 
choose an odd number when the count of class labels is even. Euclid-
ian’s distance formula is most often used for finding how far the unknown 
point is from all points in the dataset. Other measures such as Minkowski 
distance or Cosine similarity may be used. In the proposed work, Euclidean 
distance is used because the number of dimensions is not very large. 
12.2.2 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) 
Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm [5] 
used for solving both classifications as well as regression problems. For 
classification tasks, it works by fitting the best hyperplane to segregate the 
data points into the given class labels. In case the points are not linearly 
separable, it employs the kernel trick method to elevate the points in 
higher dimensions, thereby being able to make a distinction among the 
various data points. There is particular emphasis on finding out the support 
vectors – points closest to the hyperplane. Support vectors play a crucial 
role by calculating the margin and defining the separating line better. 
12.2.3 THE DATASET 
12.2.3.1 DATA COLLECTION 
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set [1] has records of 569 patients. 
Each row of data is represented using features (columns). The process of 
data collection [6] could be summarized using the following steps: 
 Step 1: Patient with tumor was recognized.

FIGURE 12.1 Count plot of diagnosis attribute containing 357 benign cases and 212 
malignant cases. 
Missing values in attributes pose problems and must be inspected 
for in the dataset. If present in large numbers, they have to be dealt with 
using standard procedures. However, the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset 
contains zero missing values. Finding the correlation among the attributes 
can prove to be significant as features which are highly correlated represent 
redundant information and may be removed from the dataset completely. 
This task is particularly important because of the presence of a large 
number of variables, where each variable represents a dimension. Having 
to deal with a higher number of variables leads to the problem of Curse 
of Dimensionality, where running times approach exponential and error 
rate increases. Separate scatter plots on attributes containing mean values, 
attributes containing standard error values and attributes containing worst 
values give clarity on how those features are correlated. 
Analyzing the scatter plots reveals almost perfect linear correlation 
among attributes mean area, mean perimeter and mean radius. There 
appears to exist linear correlation among attributes concavity mean, mean 
of number of concave points and mean compactness as well. This presents 
the problem of multi-co-linearity among these independent variables. It is 
resolved by choosing only one of these features for model building. 
The observations made on the scatter plot are verified using a correlation 
matrix. A threshold value of 0.90 is fixed, and if the correlation between 
two features lies above it, one of the features is dropped. For instance, 
the mean radius column has a correlation of 1 and 0.99, respectively with 

 
 
242 
System Design Using the Internet of Things with Deep Learning Applications 
mean perimeter and mean area, respectively. This proves that there exists 
multi-co-linearity among these features, i.e., they contain redundant infor­
mation. It would be prudent to choose only one of these features going into 
further analysis. The mean radius column is chosen and the remaining two 
are dropped. Also, features worst radius, worst perimeter and worst area 
have a correlation value above the chosen threshold when compared with 
mean radius and are hence removed from the dataset. The worst texture 
attribute is dropped and the mean texture is retained. Similarly, attributes 
such as mean concavity, worst number of concave points, standard error 
on area and standard error on perimeter are removed from the dataset. 
Ultimately, it comes down to 21 columns. 
The output class label diagnosis is separated from the independent 
attributes such as mean radius, worst value of fractal dimension, standard 
error on smoothness among others (Figure 12.2).

12.2.3.3 DATA PREPARATION FOR MODEL BUILDING 
The dataset is split into train and test sets such that 30% of data is kept 
aside for testing while the remaining 70% of data is used for training. 
Since the attribute values are in different scales, standardization is 
applied to all the features so that no feature has a greater effect on the 
model than others. 
12.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Four models are prepared separately – Model M1 (trained using KNN 
where K = 7); Model M2 (trained using KNN, where K = 5); Model M3 
(trained using KNN, where K = 3); and Model M4 (trained using SVM). 
The four models are tested separately and the results are summarized in 
Table 12.1. The metrics used for evaluating the models are precision, 
recall, F1-score (F-score) and accuracy.

Precision =

Precision measures the rate of correct positive identifications. Recall 
measures the rate of actual positives identified correctly. Accuracy gives 
an idea as to how close the predicted result is to the actual result. F measure 
takes into account both false positives and false negatives, thereby giving 
an overall weighted mean of precision and recall. These values are 
computed from the confusion matrix shown in Figure 12.3.

Comparative Analysis of SVM and KNN in Breast Cancer Classification 
On evaluating the models, it is found that M3 (KNN with K = 3) 
performs the best on the given dataset and has the highest F measure. The 
Support Vector Classifier seems to be doing better than KNN (for K = 5 
or K = 7). 
12.4 CONCLUSION 
Since this manuscript solely focuses on two algorithms – SVM and KNN 
– there was no scope to try out other classification models such as Logistic 
Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, among others. In search of 
better performance, the above methods could also be experimented with. 
In the end, it is about minimizing the human errors that get introduced 
during medical procedures. Proper prognosis based on quality data can 
go a long way in the fight against cancer in general and breast cancer in 
particular.
