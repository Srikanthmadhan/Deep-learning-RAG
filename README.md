# 📚 Deep Learning RAG (No-G)

A **non-generative Retrieval-Augmented system** for learning Deep Learning concepts from textbooks.

This project performs **semantic retrieval only** over a curated corpus of Deep Learning books.  
There is **no LLM**, **no text generation**, and **no hallucination**.  
The system retrieves relevant textbook passages using vector similarity search.

## 🔍 What this project is (and is not)

### ✅ What it is
- A **semantic search engine** for Deep Learning literature
- Uses **prebuilt embeddings + FAISS** for fast retrieval
- Deterministic, explainable, and reproducible
- Designed for **learning and reference**, not chatting

### ❌ What it is not
- Not a chatbot
- Not ChatGPT-like
- Not an LLM-based QA system
- No prompt injection, no generation, no “AI answers”
